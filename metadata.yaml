description: A portrait of early twentieth-century English life, Second String tells
  the engrossing story of Vivian Wellgood and her fianc√©, Harry Belfield, who is on
  the threshold of a brilliant political career. A sense of reckoning permeates the
  novel, as Belfield's stature begins to decline while that of an admiring follower
  a man of the people begins to rise.
