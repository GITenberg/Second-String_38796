<h2>Chapter I.</h2>

<h2>HOME AGAIN.</h2>

<p>Jack Rock stood in his shop in High Street.
He was not very often to be seen there nowadays;
he bred and bought, but he no longer
killed, and rarely sold, in person. These latter and
lesser functions he left to his deputy, Simpson, for
he had gradually developed a bye-trade which took
up much of his time, and was no less profitable than
his ostensible business. He bought horses, "made"
them into hunters, and sold them again. He was
a rare judge and a fine rider, and his heart was in
this line of work.</p>

<p>However to-day he was in his shop because the
Christmas beef was on show. Here were splendid
carcasses decked with blue rosettes, red rosettes,
or cards of "Honourable Mention;" poor bodies
sadly unconscious (as one may suppose all bodies
<a class="pagenum" id="page_6" title="pg 6"></a>
are) of their posthumous glories. Jack Rock, a
spruce spare little man with a thin red face and a
get-up of the most "horsy" order, stood before
them, expatiating to Simpson on their beauties.
Simpson, who was as fat as his master was thin,
and even redder in the face, chimed in; they were
for all the world like a couple of critics hymning
the praise of poets who have paid the debt of
nature, but are decorated with the insignia of fame.
Verily Jack Rock's shop in the days before Christmas
might well seem an Abbey or a Pantheon of
beasts.</p>

<p>"Beef for me on Christmas Day," said Jack.
"None of your turkeys or geese, or such-like
truck. Beef!" He pointed to a blue-rosetted
carcass. "Look at him; just look at him! I've
known him since he was calved. Cuts up well,
doesn't he? I'll have a joint off him for my own
table, Simpson."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do better, sir," said Simpson, just
touching, careful not to bruise, the object of eulogy
with his professional knife. A train of thought
started suddenly in his brain. "Them vegetarians,
sir!" he exclaimed. Was it wonder, or contempt,
or such sheer horror as the devotee has for atheism?
Or the depths of the first and the depths of the
second poured into the depths of the third to make
immeasurable profundity?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_7" title="pg 7"></a>
A loud burst of laughter came from the door of
the shop. Nothing startled Jack Rock. He possessed
in perfection a certain cheerful seriousness
which often marks the amateurs of the horse.
These men are accustomed to take chances, to
encounter the unforeseen, to endure disappointment,
to withstand the temptations of high success.
<i>Mens Aequa!</i> Life, though a pleasant thing, is not
a laughing matter. So Jack turned slowly and
gravely round to see whence the irreverent interruption
proceeded. But when he saw the intruder
his face lit up, and he darted across the shop with
outstretched hand. Simpson followed, hastily
rubbing his right hand on the under side of his
blue apron.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my lad, welcome home!" cried
Jack, as he greeted with a hard squeeze a young
man who stood in the doorway. "First-rate you
look too. He's filled out, eh, Simpson?" He
tapped the young man's chest appreciatively,
and surveyed his broad and massive shoulders
with almost professional admiration. "Canada's
agreed with you, Andy. Have you just got
here?"</p>

<p>"No; I got here two hours ago. You were
out, so I left my bag and went for a walk round
the old place. It seems funny to be in Meriton
again."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_8" title="pg 8"></a>
"Come into the office. We must drink your
health. You too, Simpson. Come along."</p>

<p>He led the way to a back room, where, amid
more severe furniture and appliances, there stood
a cask of beer. From this he filled three pint
mugs, and Andy Hayes' health and safe return
were duly honoured. Andy winked his eye.</p>

<p>"Them teetotallers!" he ejaculated, with a very
fair imitation of Simpson, who acknowledged the
effort with an answering wink as he drained his
mug and then left the other two to themselves.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been poking about everywhere&mdash;first
up to have a look at the old house. Not
much changed there&mdash;well, except that everything's
changed by the dear old governor's not being
there any more."</p>

<p>"Ah, it was a black Christmas that year&mdash;four
years ago now. First, the old gentleman; then
poor Nancy, a month later. She caught the fever
nursin' him; she would do it, and I couldn't stop
her. Did you go to the churchyard, Andy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went there." After a moment's grave
pause his face brightened again. "And I went
to the old school. Nobody there&mdash;it's holidays,
of course&mdash;but how everything came back to me!
There was my old seat, between Chinks and the
Bird&mdash;you know? Wat Money, I mean, and
young Tom Dove."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_9" title="pg 9"></a>
"Oh, they're both in the place still. Tom
Dove's helpin' his father at the Lion, and Wat
Money's articled to old Mr. Foulkes the lawyer."</p>

<p>"I sat down at my old desk, and, by Jove,
I absolutely seemed to hear the old governor
talking&mdash;talking about the Pentathlon. You've
heard him talk about the Pentathlon? He was
awfully keen on the Pentathlon; wanted to have
it at the sports. I believe he thought I should
win it."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly remember what it was, but
you'd have had a good go for it, Andy."</p>

<p>"Leaping, running, wrestling, throwing the
discus, hurling the spear&mdash;I think that's right.
He was talking about it the very last day I sat at
that desk&mdash;eight years ago! Yes, it's eight years
since I went out to the war, and nearly five since
I went to Canada. And I've never been back!
Well, except for not seeing him and Nancy again,
I'm glad of it. I've done better out there. There
wasn't any opening here. I wasn't clever, and if
I had been, there was no money to send me to
Oxford, though the governor was always dreaming
of that."</p>

<p>"Naturally, seein' he was B.A. Oxon, and a
gentleman himself," said Jack.</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of awe and admiration.
Andy looked at him with a smile. Among the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_10" title="pg 10"></a>
townsfolk of Meriton Andy's father had always
been looked up to by reason of the letters after
his name on the prospectus of the old grammar
school, of which he had been for thirty years the
hard-worked and very ill-paid headmaster. In
Meriton eyes the letters carried an academical
distinction great if obscure, a social distinction
equally great and far more definite. They ranked
Mr. Hayes with the gentry, and their existence
had made his second marriage&mdash;with Jack Rock
the butcher's sister&mdash;a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> of a pronounced
order. Jack himself was quite of this mind.
He had always treated his brother-in-law with
profound respect; even his great affection for
his sister had never quite persuaded him that
she had not been guilty of gross presumption in
winning Mr. Hayes' heart. He could not, even
as the second Mrs. Hayes' brother, forget the first&mdash;Andy's
mother; for she, though the gentlest
of women, had always called Jack "Butcher."
True, that was in days before Jack had won his
sporting celebrity and set up his private gig; but
none the less it would have seemed impossible to
conceive of a family alliance&mdash;even a posthumous
one&mdash;with a lady whose recognition of him was so
exclusively commercial.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not a B.A.&mdash;Oxon. or otherwise,"
laughed Andy. "I don't know whether I'm
<a class="pagenum" id="page_11" title="pg 11"></a>
a gentleman. If I am, so are you. Meriton
Grammar School is responsible for us both. And
if you're in trade, so am I. What's the difference
between timber and meat?"</p>

<p>"I expect there's a difference between Meriton
and Canada, though," Jack Rock opined shrewdly.
"Are you goin' to stay at home, or goin' back?"</p>

<p>"I shall stay here if I can develop the thing
enough to make it pay to have a man on this side.
If not, pack up! But I shall be here for the next
six months anyway, I expect."</p>

<p>"What's it worth to you?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much just now. Two hundred
a year guaranteed, and a commission&mdash;if it's earned.
But it looks like improving. Only the orders
must come in before the commission does! However
it's not so bad; I'm lucky to have found a
berth at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, lucky thing you got pals with that Canadian
fellow down in South Africa."</p>

<p>"A real stroke of luck. It was a bit hard
to make up my mind not to come home with
the boys, but I'm sure I did the right thing.
Only I'm sorry about the old governor and
Nancy."</p>

<p>"The old gentleman himself told me he thought
you'd done right."</p>

<p>"It was an opening; and it had to be taken or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_12" title="pg 12"></a>
left, then and there. So here I am, and I'm going
to start an office in London."</p>

<p>Jack Rock nodded thoughtfully; he seemed to
be revolving something in his mind. Andy's eyes
rested affectionately on him. The two had been
great friends all through Andy's boyhood. Jack
had been "Jack" to him long before he became a
family connection, and "Jack" he had continued
to be. As for the <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>&mdash;well, looking back,
Andy could not with candour deny that it had been
a surprise, perhaps even a shock. It had to some
degree robbed him of the exceptional position he
held in the grammar school, where, among the sons
of tradesmen, he alone, or almost alone, enjoyed a
vague yet real social prestige. The son shared
the father's fall. The feeling of caste is very
persistent, even though it may be shamed into
silence by modern doctrines, or by an environment
in which it is an alien plant. But he had got over
his boyish feeling now, and was delighted to come
back to Meriton as Jack Rock's visitor, and to stay
with him at the comfortable little red-brick house
adjoining the shop in High Street. In fact he
flattered himself that his service in the ranks and
his Canadian experiences had taken the last of
"that sort of nonsense" out of him. It was,
perhaps, a little too soon to pronounce so confident
a judgment.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_13" title="pg 13"></a>
Andy was smitten with a sudden compunction.
"Why, I've never asked after Harry Belfield!" he
cried.</p>

<p>He was astonished at his own disloyalty. Harry
Belfield had been the hero of his youth, his ideal,
his touchstone of excellence in all things, the
standard by which he humbly measured his own
sore deficiencies, and contemptuously assessed the
demerits of his schoolfellows. Of these Harry
had not been one. No grammar school for him!
He was the son of Mr. Belfield of Halton Park&mdash;Harrow
and Oxford were the programme for him.
The same favourable conditions gave him the
opportunity&mdash;which, of course, he took&mdash;of excelling
in all the accomplishments that Andy lacked
and envied&mdash;riding, shooting, games of skill that
cost money. The difference of position set a gulf
between the two boys. Meetings had been rare
events&mdash;to Andy always notable events, occasions
of pleasure and of excitement, landmarks in
memory. The acquaintance between the houses
had been of the slightest. In Andy's earliest days
Mr. and the first Mrs. Hayes had dined once a
year with Mr. and Mrs. Belfield; they were not
expected to return the hospitality. After Andy's
mother died and Nancy came on the scene, the
annual dinner had gone on, but it had become a
men's dinner; and Mrs. Belfield, though she bowed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_14" title="pg 14"></a>
in the street, had not called on the second Mrs.
Hayes&mdash;Nancy Rock that had been. It was not to
be expected. Yet Mr. Belfield had recognized an
equal in Andy's father; he also, perhaps, yielded
some homage to the B.A. Oxon. And Harry,
though he undoubtedly drew a line between himself
and Andy, drew another between Andy and
Andy's schoolfellows, Chinks, the Bird, and the
rest. He was rewarded&mdash;and to his worship-loving
nature it was a reward&mdash;by an adoration
due as much, perhaps, to the first line as to the
second. The more definite a line, the more
graciousness lies in stepping over it.</p>

<p>These boyish devotions are common, and commonly
are short-lived. But Andy's habit of mind
was stable and his affections tenacious. He still
felt that a meeting with Harry Belfield would be
an event.</p>

<p>"He's all right," Jack Rock answered, his tone
hardly responding to Andy's eagerness. "He's a
barrister now, you know; but I don't fancy he does
much at it. Better at spendin' money than makin'
it! If you want to see him, you can do it to-night."</p>

<p>"Can I? How?"</p>

<p>"There's talk of him bein' candidate for the
Division next election, and he's goin' to speak
at a meeting in the Town Hall to-night, him and
a chap in Parliament."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_15" title="pg 15"></a>
"Good! Which side is he?"</p>

<p>"You've been a good while away to ask that!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I have. I say, Jack, let's go."</p>

<p>"You can go; I shan't," said Jack Rock. "You'll
get back in time for supper&mdash;and need it too, I
should say. I never listen to speeches except when
they put me on a jury at assizes. Then I do like
to hear a chap fight for his man. That's racin',
that is; and I like specially, Andy, to see him
bring it off when the odds are against him. But
this politics&mdash;in my opinion, if you put their names
in a hat and drew 'em blindfolded, you'd get just
as good a Gover'ment as you do now, or just
as bad."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going for the politics. I'm going
to hear Harry Belfield."</p>

<p>"The only question as particularly interests me,"
said Jack, with one of his occasional lapses into
doubtful grammar, "is the matter of chilled
meat. But which of 'em does anything for me
there? One says 'Free Trade&mdash;let it all come!'
The other says, 'No chilled meat, certainly not,
unless it comes from British possessions'&mdash;which
is where it does come from mostly. And it's ruin
to the meat, Andy, in my opinion. I hate to see
it. Not that I lose much by it, havin' a high-class
connection. Would you like to have another look
in the shop?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_16" title="pg 16"></a>
"Suppose we say to-morrow morning?" laughed
Andy.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head; he seemed disappointed
at this lack of enthusiasm. "I've got some
beauties this Christmas," he said. "All the same
I shan't be lookin' at 'em much to-morrow
mornin'! I've got a young horse, and I want just
to show him what a foxhound's like. The meet's
at Fyfold to-morrow, Andy. I wish I could
mount you. I expect you ride fourteen, eh?"</p>

<p>"Hard on it, I fancy&mdash;and I'm a fool on a horse
anyhow. But I shall go&mdash;on shanks' mare."</p>

<p>"Will you now? Well, if you're as good on
your legs as you used to be, it's odds you'll see a
bit of the run. I recollect you in the old days,
Andy; you were hard to shake off unless the goin'
was uncommon good. Knew the country, you
did, and where the fox was likely to make for.
And I don't think you'll get the scent too good
for you to-morrow. Come along and have tea.
Oh, but you're a late-dinner man, eh?"</p>

<p>"Dinner when, where, and how it comes! Tea
sounds capital&mdash;with supper after my meeting. I
say, Jack, it's good to see you again!"</p>

<p>"Wish you'd stay here, lad. I'm much alone
these days&mdash;with the old gentleman gone, and
poor Nancy gone!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall. Anyhow I might stay here
<a class="pagenum" id="page_17" title="pg 17"></a>
for the summer, and go up to town to the
office."</p>

<p>"Aye, you might do that, anyhow." Again
Jack Rock seemed meditative, as though he had
an idea and were half-minded to disclose it. But
he was a man of caution; he bided his time.</p>

<p>Andy&mdash;nobody had ever called him Andrew
since the parson who christened him&mdash;seemed to
himself to have got home again, very thoroughly
home again. Montreal with its swelling hill, its
mighty river, its winter snow, its Frenchness, its
opposing self-defensive, therefore self-assertive,
Britishness, was very remote. A talk with Jack
Rock, a Conservative meeting with a squire in the
chair (that was safely to be assumed), a meet of the
hounds next morning&mdash;these and a tide of intimate
personal memories stamped him as at home again.
The long years in the little house at the extreme
end of Highcroft&mdash;Highcroft led out of High
Street, tending to the west, Fyfold way&mdash;in the old
grammar school, in the peace of the sleepy town&mdash;had
been a poignant memory in South Africa, a
fading dream in the city by the great river. They
sprang again into actuality. If he felt a certain
contraction in his horizon he felt also a peace in
his mind. Meriton might or might not admire
"hustlers;" it did not hustle itself. It was a
parasitic little town; it had no manufactures, no
<a class="pagenum" id="page_18" title="pg 18"></a>
special industry. It lived on the country surrounding
it&mdash;on the peasants, the farmers, the
landowners. So it did not grow; neither did it
die. It remained much as it had been for hundreds
of years, save that it was seriously considering the
introduction of electric light.</p>

<p>The meeting was rather of an impromptu order;
Christmas holidays are generally held sacred from
such functions. But Mr. Foot, M.P., a rising
young member and a friend of Harry Belfield's,
happened to be staying at Halton Park for shooting.
Why waste him? He liked to speak, and
he spoke very well. The more Harry showed
himself and got himself heard, the better. The
young men would enjoy it. A real good dinner
beforehand would send them down in rare spirits.
A bit of supper, with a whisky-and-soda or two,
and recollections of their own "scores," would
end the evening pleasantly. Meriton would not
be excited&mdash;it was not election time&mdash;but it would
be amused, benevolent, and present in sufficiently
large numbers to make the thing go with <i>&eacute;clat</i>.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, one topic which, from a
platform at all events, one could describe as
"burning." A Bill dealing with the sale of intoxicating
liquor had, the session before, been introduced
as the minimum a self-respecting nation
could do, abused as the maximum fanatics could
<a class="pagenum" id="page_19" title="pg 19"></a>
clamour for, carried through a second reading
considerably amended, and squeezed out by other
matters. It was to be re-introduced. The nation
was recommended to consider the question in the
interval. Now the nation, though professing its
entire desire to be sober&mdash;it could not well do
anything else&mdash;was not sure that it desired to be
made sober, was not quite clear as to the precise
point at which it could or could not be held to be
sober, and felt that the argument that it would, by
the gradual progress of general culture, become
sober in the next generation or so&mdash;without feeling
the change, so to say, and with no violent break
in the habits of this generation (certainly everybody
must wish the next generation to be sober)&mdash;that
this argument, which men of indisputable
wisdom adduced, had great attractions. Also the
nation was much afraid of the teetotallers, especially
of the subtle ones who said that true freedom lay
in freedom from temptation. The nation thought
that sort of freedom not much worth having,
whether in the matter of drink or of any other
pleasure. So there were materials for a lively and
congenial discussion, and Mr. Foot, M.P., was
already in the thick of it when Andy Hayes, rather
late by reason of having been lured into the stables
to see the hunters after tea, reached the Town
Hall and sidled his way to a place against the wall
<a class="pagenum" id="page_20" title="pg 20"></a>
in good view of the platform and of the front
benches where the big-wigs sat. The Town Hall
was quite two-thirds full&mdash;very good indeed for
the Christmas season!</p>

<p>Andy Hayes was not much of a politician. Up
to now he had been content with the politics of
his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>, the politics of a man trying to build up
a business. But it was impossible not to enjoy
Mr. Foot. He riddled the enemy with epigram
till he fell to the earth, then he jumped on to his
prostrate form and chopped it to pieces with logic.
He set his audience wondering&mdash;this always
happens at political meetings, whichever party may
be in power&mdash;by what odd freak of fate, by what
inexplicable blunder, the twenty men chosen to
rule the country should be not only the twenty
most unprincipled but also the twenty stupidest in
it. Mr. Foot demonstrated the indisputable truth
of this strange fact so cogently before he had been
on his legs twenty minutes that gradually Andy
felt absolved from listening any longer to so plain
a matter; his attention began to wander to the
company. It was a well-to-do audience&mdash;there
were not many poor in Meriton. A few old folk
might have to go to "the house," but there were
no distress or "unemployment" troubles. The
tradesfolk, their families, and employees formed
the bulk. They were presided over by Mr.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_21" title="pg 21"></a>
Wellgood of Nutley, who might be considered to
hold the place of second local magnate, after Mr.
Belfield of Halton. He was a spare, strongly
built man of two or three and forty; his hair was
clipped very close to his head; he wore a bristly
moustache just touched with gray, but it too was
kept so short that the lines of his mouth, with its
firm broad lips, were plain to see; his eyes were
light-blue, hard, and wary; they seemed to keep a
constant watch over the meeting, and once, when
a scuffle arose among some children at the back of
the hall, they gave out a fierce and formidable
glance of rebuke. He had the reputation of being
a strict master and a stern magistrate; but he was
a good sportsman, and Jack Rock's nearest rival
after the hounds.</p>

<p>Beside him, waiting his turn to speak and
seeming rather nervous&mdash;he was not such an old
hand at the game as Mr. Foot&mdash;sat Andy's hero,
Harry Belfield. He was the pet of the town for
his gay manner, good looks, and cheery accessibility
to every man&mdash;and even more to every woman.
His youthful record was eminently promising, his
career the subject of high hopes to his family and
his fellow-citizens. Tall and slight, wearing his
clothes with an elegance free from affectation, he
suggested "class" and "blood" in every inch of
him. He was rather pale, with thick, soft, dark
<a class="pagenum" id="page_22" title="pg 22"></a>
hair; his blue eyes were vivacious and full of
humour, his mouth a little small, but delicate and
sensitive, the fingers of his hands long and tapering.
"A thoroughbred" was the only possible verdict&mdash;evidently
also a man full of sensibility, awake to
the charms of life as well as to its labours; that
was in keeping with all Andy's memories.</p>

<p>The moment he rose it was obvious with what
favour he was regarded; the audience was predisposed
towards all he said. He was not so
epigrammatic nor so cruelly logical as Mr. Foot;
he was easier, more colloquial, more confidential;
he had some chaff for his hearers as well as
denunciation for his enemies; his speech was
seasoned now by a local allusion, now by a sporting
simile. A veteran might have found its strongest
point of promise in its power of adaptation to the
listeners, its gift of creating sympathy between
them and the speaker by the grace of a very
attractive personality. It was a success, perhaps,
more of charm than of strength; but it may be
doubted whether in the end the one does not carry
as far as the other.</p>

<p>On good terms as he was with them all, it soon
became evident to so interested an onlooker as
Andy Hayes that he was on specially good terms,
or at any rate anxious to be, in one particular
quarter. After he had made a point and was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_23" title="pg 23"></a>
waiting for the applause to die down, not once but
three or four times he smiled directly towards the
front row, and towards that part of it where two
young women sat side by side. They were among
his most enthusiastic auditors, and Andy presently
found himself, by a natural leaning towards any
one who admired Harry Belfield, according to
them a share of the attention which had hitherto
been given exclusively to the hero himself.</p>

<p>The pair made a strong contrast. There was a
difference of six or seven years only in their ages,
but while the one seemed scarcely more than a
child, it was hard to think of the other as even a
girl&mdash;there was about her such an air of self-possession,
of conscious strength, of a maturity of
faculties. Even in applauding she seemed also to
judge and assess. Her favour was discriminating;
she let the more easy hits go by with a slight,
rather tolerant smile, while her neighbour greeted
them with outright merry laughter. She was not
much beyond medium height, but of full build,
laid on ample lines; her features were rather large,
and her face wore, in repose, a thoughtful tranquillity.
The other, small, frail, and delicate, with
large eyes that seemed to wonder even as she
laughed, would turn to her friend with each laugh
and appear to ask her sympathy&mdash;or even her
permission to be pleased.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_24" title="pg 24"></a>
Andy's scrutiny&mdash;somewhat prolonged since it
yielded him all the above particulars&mdash;was ended
by his becoming aware that he in his turn was the
object of an attention not less thoroughgoing.
Turning back to the platform, he found the chairman's
hard and alert eyes fixed on him in a gaze
that plainly asked who he was and why he was so
much interested in the two girls. Andy blushed
in confusion at being caught, but Mr. Wellgood
made no haste to relieve him from his rebuking
glance. He held him under it for full half a
minute, turning away, indeed, only when Harry
sat down among the cheers of the meeting. What
business was it of Wellgood's if Andy did forget
his manners and stare too hard at the girls? The
next moment Andy laughed at himself for the
question. In a sudden flash he remembered the
younger girl. She was Wellgood's daughter
Vivien. He recalled her now as a little child; he
remembered the wondering eyes and the timidly
mirthful curl of her lips. Was it really as long
ago as that since he had been in Meriton?
However childlike she might look, now she was
grown-up!</p>

<p>His thoughts, which carried him through the
few sentences with which the chairman dismissed
the meeting, were scattered by the sudden grasp of
Harry Belfield's hand. The moment he saw Andy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_25" title="pg 25"></a>
he ran down from the platform to him. His
greeting was all his worshipper could ask.</p>

<p>"Well now, I am glad to see you back!" he
cried. "Oh, we all heard how well you'd done
out at the front, and we thought it too bad of you
not to come back and be lionized. But here you
are at last, and it's all right. I must take Billy
Foot home now&mdash;he's got to go to town at heaven
knows what hour in the morning&mdash;but we must
have a good jaw soon. Are you at the Lion?"</p>

<p>"No," said Andy, "I'm staying a day or two
with Jack Rock."</p>

<p>"With Jack Rock?" Harry's voice sounded
surprised. "Oh yes, of course, I remember!
He's a capital chap, old Jack! But if you're going
to stay&mdash;and I hope you are, old fellow&mdash;you'll
want some sort of a place of your own, won't you?
Well, good-night. I'll hunt you up some time in
the next day or two, for certain. Did you like my
speech?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I expected you to make a good one."</p>

<p>"You shall hear me make better ones than
that. Well, I really must&mdash;All right, Billy, I'm
coming." With another clasp of the hand he
rushed after Mr. Foot, who was undisguisedly in
a hurry, shouting as he went, "Good-night, Wellgood!
Good-night, Vivien! Good-night, Miss
Vintry!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_26" title="pg 26"></a>
Miss Vintry&mdash;that was the other girl, the one
with Vivien Wellgood. Andy was glad to know
her name and docket her by it in her place among
the impressions of the evening.</p>

<p>So home to a splendid round of cold beef and
another pint of that excellent beer at Jack Rock's.
What days life sometimes gives&mdash;or used to!</p>

<h2>Chapter II.<a class="pagenum" id="page_27" title="pg 27"></a></h2>

<h2>A VERY LITTLE HUNTING.</h2>

<p>If more were needed to make a man feel at
home&mdash;more than old Meriton itself, Jack
Rock with his beef, and the clasp of Harry Belfield's
hand&mdash;the meet of the hounds supplied it.
There were hunts in other lands; Andy could
not persuade himself that there were meets like
this, so entirely English it seemed in the manner
of it. Everybody was there, high and low, rich
and poor, young and old. An incredible coincidence
of unplausible accidents had caused an
extraordinary number of people to have occasion
to pass by Fyfold Green that morning at that
hour, let alone all the folk who chanced to have
a "morning off" and proposed to see some of
the run, on horseback or on foot. The tradesmen's
carts were there in a cluster, among them
two of Jack Rock's: his boys knew that a blind
eye would be turned to half an hour's lateness
in the delivery of the customers' joints. For
<a class="pagenum" id="page_28" title="pg 28"></a>
centre of the scene were the waving tails, the
glossy impatient horses, the red coats, the Master
himself, Lord Meriton, in his glory and, it may
be added, in the peremptory mood which is traditionally
associated with his office.</p>

<p>Andy Hayes moved about, meeting many old
friends&mdash;more, indeed, than he recognized, till
a reminiscence of old days established for them
again a place in his memory. He saw Tom Dove&mdash;the
Bird&mdash;mounted on a showy screw. Wat
Money&mdash;Chinks&mdash;was one of those who "happened
to be passing" on his way to a client's who
lived in the opposite direction. He gave Andy
a friendly greeting, and told him that if he
thought of taking a house in Meriton, he should
be careful about his lease: Foulkes, Foulkes, and
Askew would look after it. Jack Rock was there,
of course, keeping himself to himself, on the
outskirts of the throng: the young horse was
nervous. Harry Belfield, in perfect array, talked
to Vivien Wellgood, her father on a raking hunter
close beside them. A great swell of home-feeling
assailed Andy; suddenly he had a passionate hope
that the timber business would develop; he did
not want to go back to Canada.</p>

<p>It was a good hunting morning, cloudy and
cool, with the wind veering to the north-east and
dropping as it veered. No frost yet, but the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_29" title="pg 29"></a>
weather-wise predicted one before long. The
scent should be good&mdash;a bit too good, Andy reflected,
for riders on shanks' mare. Their turn
is best served by a scent somewhat variable and
elusive. A check here and there, a fresh cast,
the hounds feeling for the scent&mdash;these things,
added to a cunning use of short cuts and a knowledge
of the country shared by the fox, aid them
to keep on terms and see something of the run&mdash;just
as they aid the heavy old gentlemen on big
horses and the small boys on fat ponies to get
their humble share of the sport.</p>

<p>But in truth Andy cared little so that he could
run&mdash;run hard, fast, and long. His powerful
body craved work, work, and work yet more
abundantly. His way of indulging it was to call
on it for all its energies; he exulted in feeling
its brave response. Fatigue he never knew&mdash;at
least not till he had changed and bathed; and
then it was not real fatigue: it was no more than
satiety. Now when they had found&mdash;and they
had the luck to find directly&mdash;he revelled in the
heavy going of a big ploughed field. He was
at the game he loved.</p>

<p>Yes, but the pace was good&mdash;distinctly good.
The spirit was willing, but human legs are but
human, and only two in number. Craft was required.
The fox ran straight now&mdash;but had he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_30" title="pg 30"></a>
never a thought in his mind? The field streamed
off to the right, lengthening out as it went. Andy
bore to his left: he remembered Croxton's Dip.
Did the fox? That was the question. If he
did, the hunt would describe the two sides of a
triangle, while Andy cut across the base.</p>

<p>He was out of sight of the field now, but he
could hear the hounds giving tongue from time
to time and the thud of the hoofs. The sounds
grew nearer! A thrill of triumph ran through
him; his old-time knowledge had not failed him.
The fox had doubled back, making for Croxton's
Dip. Over the edge of yonder hill it lay, half
a mile off&mdash;a deep depression in the ground,
covered with thick undergrowth. In the hope
of catching up, Andy Hayes felt that he could
run all day and grudge the falling of an over-hasty
night.</p>

<p>"Blown," indeed, but no more than a rest of
a minute would put right, he reached the ledge
whence the ground sloped down sharply to the
Dip. He was in time to see the hunt race past
him along the bottom&mdash;leaders, the ruck, stragglers.
Jack Rock and Wellgood were with the
Master in the van; he could not make out Harry
Belfield; a forlorn figure looking like the Bird
laboured far in the rear.</p>

<p>They swept into the Dip as Andy started to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_31" title="pg 31"></a>
race down the slope. But to his chagrin they
swept out of it again, straight up a long slope
which rose on his left, the fox running game,
a near kill promising, a fast point-to-point secured.
The going was too good for shanks' mare to-day.
Before he got to the bottom even the Bird had
galloped by, walloping his showy screw.</p>

<p>To the left, then, and up that long slope!
There was nothing else for it, if he were so much
as to see the kill from afar. This was exercise,
if you like! His heart throbbed like the engines
of a great ship; the sweat broke out on him. Oh,
it was fine! That slope must be won&mdash;then
Heaven should send the issue!</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;even as he braced himself to face
the long ascent, as the last sounds from the hunt
died away over its summit&mdash;he saw a derelict,
and, amazed, came to a full stop.</p>

<p>The girl was not on her pony; she was standing
beside it. The pony appeared distressed, and
the girl looked no whit more cheerful. With a
pang to the very heart, Andy Hayes recognized
a duty, and acknowledged it by a snatch at his
cap.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; anything wrong?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He had been interested in Vivien Wellgood
the evening before, but he was much more than
<a class="pagenum" id="page_32" title="pg 32"></a>
interested in the hunt. Still, she looked forlorn
and desolate.</p>

<p>"Would you mind looking at my pony's right
front leg?" she asked. "I think he's gone lame."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about horses, but he does
seem to stand rather gingerly on his&mdash;er&mdash;right
front leg. And he's certainly badly blown&mdash;worse
than I am!"</p>

<p>"We shall never catch them, shall we? It's
not the least use going on, is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I know the country; if
you'd let me pilot you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry Belfield was going to pilot me, but&mdash;well,
I told him not to wait for me, and he didn't.
You were at the meeting last night, weren't you?
You're Mr. Hayes, aren't you? What did you
think of the speeches?"</p>

<p>"Really, you know, if we're to have a chance
of seeing any more of the&mdash;" It was not the
moment to discuss political speeches, however
excellent.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see any more of it. I'll go
home; I'll risk it."</p>

<p>"Risk what?" he asked. There seemed no
risk in going home; and there was, by now, small
profit in going on.</p>

<p>She did not answer his question. "I think
hunting's the most wretched amusement I've ever
<a class="pagenum" id="page_33" title="pg 33"></a>
tried!" she broke out. "The pony's lame&mdash;yes,
he is; I've torn my habit" (she exhibited a sore
rent); "I've scratched my face" (her finger indicated
the wound); "and here I am! All I
hope is that they won't catch that poor fox. How
far do you think it is to Nutley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about three miles, I should think. You
could strike the road half a mile from here."</p>

<p>"I'm sure the pony's lame. I shall go
back."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to come with you?"</p>

<p>During their talk her eyes had wavered between
indignation and piteousness&mdash;the one at the so-called
sport of hunting, the other for her own
woes. At Andy's question a gleam of welcome
flashed into them, followed in an instant by a
curious sort of veiling of all expression. She
made a pathetic little figure, with her habit sorely
rent and a nasty red scratch across her forehead.
The pony lame too&mdash;if he were lame! Andy hit
on the idea that it was a question whether he were
lame enough to swear by: that was what she was
going to risk&mdash;in a case to be tried before some
tribunal to which she was amenable.</p>

<p>"But don't you want to go on?" she asked.
"You're enjoying it, aren't you?" The question
carried no rebuke; it recognized as legitimate
the widest differences of taste.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_34" title="pg 34"></a>
"I haven't the least chance of catching up with
them. I may as well come back with you."</p>

<p>The curious expression&mdash;or rather eclipse of
expression&mdash;was still in her eyes, a purely negative
defensiveness that seemed as though it could
spring only from an instinctive resolve to show
nothing of her feelings. The eyes were a dark
blue; but with Vivien's eyes colour never counted
for much, nor their shape, nor what one would
roughly call their beauty, were it more or less.
Their meaning&mdash;that was what they set a man
asking after.</p>

<p>"It really would be very kind of you," she said.</p>

<p>Andy mounted her on the suppositiously lame
pony&mdash;her weight wouldn't hurt him much, anyhow&mdash;and
they set out at a walk towards the
highroad which led to Nutley and thence, half
a mile farther on, to Meriton.</p>

<p>She was silent till they reached the road. Then
she asked abruptly, "Are you ever afraid?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Andy, with a laugh, "I
never know whether I'm afraid or only excited&mdash;in
fighting, I mean. Otherwise I don't fancy I'm
either often."</p>

<p>"Well, you're big," she observed. "I'm afraid
of pretty nearly everything&mdash;horses, dogs, motor-cars&mdash;and
I'm passionately afraid of hunting."</p>

<p>"You're not big, you see," said Andy consolingly.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_35" title="pg 35"></a>
Indeed her hand on the reins looked
almost ridiculously small.</p>

<p>"I've got to learn not to be afraid of things.
My father's teaching me. You know who I am,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; why, I remember you years ago!
Is that why you're out hunting?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And why you think that the pony&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is lame enough to let me risk going home?
Yes." There was a hint of defiance in her voice.
"You must think what you like," she seemed to say.</p>

<p>Andy considered the matter in his impartial,
solid, rather slowly moving mind. It was foolish
to be frightened at such things; it must be wholesome
to be taught not to be. Still, hunting wasn't
exactly a moral duty, and the girl looked very
fragile. He had not arrived at any final decision
on the case&mdash;on the issue whether the girl were
silly or the father cruel (the alternatives might
not be true alternatives, not strictly exclusive of
one another)&mdash;before she spoke again.</p>

<p>"And then I'm fastidious. Are you?"</p>

<p>"I hope not!" said Andy, with an amused
chuckle. A great lump of a fellow like him
fastidious!</p>

<p>"Father doesn't like that either, and I've got
to get over it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_36" title="pg 36"></a>
"How does it&mdash;er&mdash;take you?" Andy made
bold to inquire.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of ways. I hate dirt, and dust, and
getting very hot, and going into butchers' shops,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Butchers' shops!" exclaimed Andy, rather hit
on the raw. "You eat meat, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Things don't look half as dead when they're
cooked. I couldn't touch a butcher!" Horror
rang in her tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I say, Jack Rock's a butcher, and
he's about the best fellow in Meriton. You know
him?"</p>

<p>"I've seen him," she admitted reluctantly, the
subject being evidently distasteful.</p>

<p>For the second time Andy Hayes was conscious
of a duty: he must not be&mdash;or seem&mdash;ashamed
of Jack Rock, just because this girl was fastidious.</p>

<p>"I'm related to him, you know. My stepmother
was his sister. And I'm staying in his house."</p>

<p>She glanced at him, a slight flush rising to her
cheeks; he saw that her lips trembled a little.</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to unsay things, is it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," laughed Andy. "Don't think I'm
hurt; but I should be a low-down fellow if I didn't
stand up for old Jack."</p>

<p>"I should rather like to have you to stand
<a class="pagenum" id="page_37" title="pg 37"></a>
up for me sometimes," she said, and broke into
a smile as she added, "You're so splendidly solid,
you see, Mr. Hayes. Here we are at home&mdash;you
may as well make a complete thing of it and see
me as far as the stables."</p>

<p>"I'd like to come in&mdash;I'm not exactly a stranger
here. I've often been a trespasser. Don't tell
Mr. Wellgood unless you think he'll forgive me,
but as a boy I used to come and bathe in the lake
early in the morning&mdash;before anybody was up.
I used to undress in the bushes and slip in for
my swim pretty nearly every morning in the
summer. It's fine bathing, but you want to be
able to swim; there's a strong undercurrent, where
the stream runs through. Are you fond of
bathing?"</p>

<p>Andy was hardly surprised when she gave a
little shudder. "No, I'm rather afraid of water."
She added quickly, "Don't tell my father, or I
expect I should have to try to learn to swim. He
hasn't thought of that yet. No more has Isobel&mdash;Miss
Vintry, my companion. You know? You
saw her at the meeting. I have a companion now,
instead of a governess. Isobel isn't afraid of
anything, and she's here to teach me not to
be."</p>

<p>"You don't mind my asking your father to let
me come and swim, if I'm here in the summer?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_38" title="pg 38"></a>
"I don't suppose I ought to mind that," she said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>The house stood with its side turned to the
drive by which they approached it from the
Meriton road. Its long, low, irregular front&mdash;it
was a jumble of styles and periods&mdash;faced the lake,
a stone terrace running between the fa&ccedil;ade and the
water; it was backed by a thick wood; across the
lake the bushes grew close down to the water's
edge. The drive too ran close by the water, deep
water as Andy was well aware, and was fenced from
it by a wooden paling, green from damp. The
place had a certain picturesqueness, but a sadness
too. Water and trees&mdash;trees and water&mdash;and
between them the long squat house. To Andy
it seemed to brood there like a toad. But
his healthy mind reverted to the fact that
for a strong swimmer the bathing was really
splendid.</p>

<p>"Here comes Isobel! Now nothing about
swimming, and say the pony's lame!"</p>

<p>The injunction recalled Andy from his meditations
and also served to direct his attention to
Miss Vintry, who stood, apparently waiting for
them, at the end of the drive, with the house on
her right and the stables on her left. She was
dressed in a business-like country frock, rather
noticeably short, and carried a stick with a spike
<a class="pagenum" id="page_39" title="pg 39"></a>
at the end of it. She looked very efficient and
also very handsome.</p>

<p>Vivien told her story: Andy, not claiming
expert knowledge, yet stoutly maintained that the
pony was&mdash;or anyhow had been&mdash;lame.</p>

<p>"He seems to be getting over it," said Miss
Vintry, with a smile that was not malicious but
was, perhaps, rather annoyingly amused. "I'm
afraid your having had to turn back will vex your
father, but I suppose there was no help for it, and
I'm sure he'll be much obliged to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hayes." Vivien supplied the name, and
Andy made his bow.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I've heard Mr. Harry Belfield speak of
you." Her tone was gracious, and she smiled at
Andy good-humouredly. If she confirmed his
impression of capability, and perhaps added a new
one of masterfulness, there was at least nothing to
hint that her power would not be well used or that
her sway would be other than benevolent.</p>

<p>Vivien had dismounted, and a stable-boy was
leading the pony away, after receiving instructions
to submit the suspected off fore-leg to his chief's
inspection. There seemed nothing to keep Andy,
and he was about to take his leave when Miss
Vintry called to the retreating stable-boy, "Oh,
and let Curly out, will you? He hasn't had his
run this afternoon."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_40" title="pg 40"></a>
Vivien turned her head towards the stables with
a quick apprehensive jerk. A big black retriever,
released in obedience to Isobel Vintry's order, ran
out, bounding joyously. He leapt up at Isobel,
pawing her and barking in an ecstasy of delight.
In passing Andy, the stranger, he gave him
another bark of greeting and a hasty pawing; then
he clumsily gambolled on to where Vivien stood.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you, Vivien. You know he
won't hurt you, don't you?" The dog certainly
seemed to warrant Isobel's assertion; he appeared
a most good-natured animal, though his play was
rough.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he won't hurt me," said Vivien.</p>

<p>The dog leapt up at her, barking, frisking,
pawing her, trying to reach her face to lick it.
She made no effort to repel him; she had a little
riding-whip in her hand, but she did not use it;
her arms hung at her side; she was rather pale.</p>

<p>"There! It's not so terrible after all, is it?"
asked Isobel. "Down, Curly, down! Come
here!"</p>

<p>The dog obeyed her at her second bidding, and
sat down at her feet. Andy was glad to see that
the ordeal&mdash;for that was what it looked like&mdash;was
over, and had been endured with tolerable fortitude;
he had not enjoyed the scene. Somewhat
to his surprise Vivien's lips curved in a smile.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_41" title="pg 41"></a>
"Somehow I wasn't nearly so frightened to-day,"
she said. Apparently the ordeal was a daily one&mdash;perhaps
one of several daily ones, for she had
already been out hunting. "I didn't run away
as I did yesterday, when Harry Belfield was here."</p>

<p>"You are getting used to it," Isobel affirmed.
"Mr. Wellgood's quite right. We shall have you
as brave as a lion in a few months." Her tone
was not unkind or hard, neither was it sympathetic.
It was just extremely matter-of-fact. "It's all
nerves," she added to Andy. "She overworked
herself at school&mdash;she's very clever, aren't you,
Vivien?&mdash;and now she's got to lead an open-air
life. She must get used to things, mustn't she?"</p>

<p>Andy had a shamefaced feeling that the ordeals
or lessons, if they were necessary at all, had better
be conducted in privacy. That had not apparently
occurred to Mr. Wellgood or to Isobel Vintry.
Indeed that aspect of the case did not seem to
trouble Vivien herself either; she showed no signs
of shame; she was smiling still, looking rather
puzzled.</p>

<p>"I wonder why I was so much less frightened."
She turned her eyes suddenly to Andy. "I know.
It was because you were there!"</p>

<p>"You ran away, in spite of Mr. Harry's being
here yesterday," Isobel reminded her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hayes is so splendidly big&mdash;so splendidly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_42" title="pg 42"></a>
big and solid," said Vivien, thoughtfully regarding
Andy's proportions. "When he's here, I don't
think I shall be half so much afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, then Mr. Wellgood must ask him to come
again," laughed Isobel. "You see how useful
you'll be, Mr. Hayes!"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to come again, anyhow,
if I'm asked&mdash;whether I'm useful or not. And
I think it was jolly plucky of you to stand still
as you did, Miss Wellgood. If I were in a funk,
I should cut and run for it, I know."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd been a soldier," said Isobel.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's different when there are a lot
of you together. Besides&mdash;" He chuckled.
"You're not going to get me to let on that I was
in a funk then. Those are our secrets, Miss
Vintry. Well now, I must go, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, there are no more tests of courage to-day,
Mr. Hayes," laughed Isobel.</p>

<p>Vivien's eyes had relapsed into inexpressiveness;
they told Andy nothing of her view of the trials,
or of Miss Vintry, who had conducted the latest
one; they told him no more of her view of
himself as she gave him her hand in farewell. He
left her still standing on the spot where she had
endured Curly's violent though well-meant attentions&mdash;again
rather a pathetic figure, in her torn
habit, with the long red scratch (by-the-by Miss
<a class="pagenum" id="page_43" title="pg 43"></a>
Vintry had made no inquiry about it&mdash;that was
part of the system perhaps) on her forehead, and
with the background, as it were, of ordeals, or
tests, or whatever they were to be called. Andy
wondered what they would try her with to-morrow,
and found himself sorry that he would not be there&mdash;to
help her with his bigness and solidity.</p>

<p>It was difficult to say that Mr. Wellgood's
system was wrong. It was absurd for a grown
girl&mdash;a girl living in the country&mdash;to be frightened
at horses, dogs, and motor-cars, to be disgusted by
dirt and dust, by getting very hot&mdash;and by butchers'
shops. All these were things which she would
have to meet on her way through the world, as
the world is at present constituted. Still he was
sorry for her; she was so slight and frail. Andy
would have liked to take on his broad shoulders
all her worldly share of dogs and horses, of dust,
of getting very hot (a thing he positively liked),
and of butchers; these things would not have
troubled him in the least; he would have borne
them as easily as he could have carried Vivien
herself in his arms. As he walked home he had
a vision of her shuddering figure, with its pale face
and reticent eyes, being led by Isobel Vintry's firm
hand into Jack Rock's shop in High Street, and
there being compelled to inspect, to touch, to
smell, the blue-rosetted, red-rosetted, and honourably
<a class="pagenum" id="page_44" title="pg 44"></a>
mentioned carcasses which adorned that Valhalla
of beasts&mdash;nay, being forced, in spite of all horror,
to touch Jack Rock the butcher himself! Isobel
Vintry would, he thought, be capable of shutting
her up alone with all those dead things, and with
the man who, as she supposed, had butchered them.</p>

<p>"I should have to break in the door!" thought
Andy, his vanity flattered by remembering that she
had seen in him a stand-by, and a security which
apparently even Harry Belfield had been unable to
afford. True it was that in order to win the rather
humble compliment of being held a protection
against an absolutely harmless retriever dog he had
lost his day's hunting. Andy's heart was lowly;
he did not repine.</p>

<h2>Chapter III.<a class="pagenum" id="page_45" title="pg 45"></a></h2>

<h2>THE POTENT VOICE.</h2>

<p>After anxious consultation at Halton it had
been decided that Harry Belfield was justified
in adopting a political career and treating the
profession of the Bar, to which he had been called,
as nominal. The prospects of an opening&mdash;and
an opening in his native Division&mdash;were rosy.
His personal qualifications admitted of no dispute,
his social standing was all that could be desired.
The money was the only difficulty. Mr. Belfield's
income, though still large, was not quite what it
had been; he was barely rich enough to support
his son in what is still, in spite of all that has
been done in the cause of electoral purity, a
costly career. However the old folk exercised
economies, Harry promised them, and it was
agreed that the thing could be managed. It was,
perhaps, at the back of the father's mind that
for a young man of his son's attractions there was
one obvious way of increasing his income&mdash;quite
<a class="pagenum" id="page_46" title="pg 46"></a>
obvious and quite proper for the future owner of
Halton Park.</p>

<p>For the moment political affairs were fairly
quiet&mdash;next year it would be different&mdash;and Harry,
ostensibly engaged on a course of historical and
sociological reading, spent his time pleasantly
between Meriton and his rooms in Jermyn Street.
He had access to much society of one kind and
another, and was universally popular; his frank
delight in pleasing people made him pleasant to
them. With women especially he was a great
favourite, not for his looks only, though they
were a passport to open the door of any drawing-room,
but more because they felt that he was a
man who appreciated them, valued them, needed
them, to whom they were a very big and precious
part of life. He had not a shred of that
indifference&mdash;that independence of them&mdash;which
is the worst offence in women's eyes. Knowing
that they counted for so much to him, it was as
fair as it was natural that they should let him
count for a good deal with them.</p>

<p>But even universal favourites have their particular
ties. For the last few months Harry had
been especially attached to Mrs. Freere, the wife
of a member of Parliament of his own party who
lived in Grosvenor Street. Mr. Freere was an
exceedingly laborious person; he sat on more
<a class="pagenum" id="page_47" title="pg 47"></a>
committees than any man in London, and had
little leisure for the joys of home life. Mrs.
Freere could take very good care of herself, and,
all question of principles apart, had no idea of
risking the position and the comforts she enjoyed.
Subject to the limits thus clearly imposed on her,
she had no objection at all to her friendship with
Harry Belfield being as sentimental as Harry had
been disposed to make it; indeed she had a taste
for that kind of thing herself. Once or twice he
had tried to overstep the limits, elastic as they were&mdash;he
was impulsive, Mrs. Freere was handsome&mdash;but
he had accepted her rebuke with frank penitence,
and the friendship had been switched back
on to its appointed lines without an accident. The
situation was pleasant to her; she was convinced
that it was good for Harry. Certainly he met at her
house many people whom it was proper and useful
for him to meet; and her partiality offered him
every opportunity of making favourable impressions.
If her conscience needed any other salve&mdash;it
probably did not feel the need acutely&mdash;she
could truthfully aver that she was in the constant
habit of urging him to lose no time in looking out
for a suitable wife.</p>

<p>"A wife is such a help to a man in the House,"
she would say. "She can keep half the bores
away from him. I don't do it because Wilson
<a class="pagenum" id="page_48" title="pg 48"></a>
positively loves bores&mdash;being bored gives him a
sense of serving his country&mdash;but I could if he'd
let me."</p>

<p>Harry had been accustomed to meet such prudent
counsels with protests of a romantic order; but
Mrs. Freere, a shrewd woman, had for some weeks
past noticed that the protests were becoming rather
less vehement, and decidedly more easy for her
to control. When she repeated her advice one
day, in the spring after Andy Hayes came back
from Canada, Harry looked at her for a moment
and said,</p>

<p>"Would you drop me altogether if I did,
Lily?" He called her Lily when they were
alone.</p>

<p>"I'm married; you haven't dropped me," said
Mrs. Freere with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's different. I shouldn't marry a
woman unless I was awfully in love with her."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ought to make that a reason
for finally dropping you, because you'll probably
be awfully in love with several. Put that difficulty&mdash;if
it is one&mdash;out of your mind. We shall be
friends."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't mind? You&mdash;you wouldn't
think it&mdash;?" He wanted to ask her whether she
would think it what, on previous occasions, he had
said that he would think it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_49" title="pg 49"></a>
Mrs. Freere laughed. "Oh, of course your
wife would be rather a bore&mdash;just at first, anyhow.
But, you know, I can even contemplate my life
without you altogether, Harry." She was really
fond of him, but she was not a woman given to
illusions either about her friends or about herself.</p>

<p>Harry did not protest that he could not contemplate
his life without Mrs. Freere, though he
had protested that on more than one of those
previous occasions. Mrs. Freere leant against the
mantelpiece, smiling down at him in the armchair.</p>

<p>"Seen somebody?" she asked.</p>

<p>Harry blushed hotly. "You're an awfully good
sort, Lily," he said.</p>

<p>She laughed a little, then sighed a little. Well,
it had been very agreeable to have this handsome
boy at her beck and call, gracefully adoring,
flattering her vanity, amusing her leisure, giving
her the luxury of reflecting that she was behaving
well in the face of considerable temptation&mdash;she
really felt entitled to plume herself on this exploit.
But such things could not last&mdash;Mrs. Freere knew
that. The balance was too delicate; a topple over
on one side or the other was bound to come; she
had always meant that the toppling over, when it
came, should be on the safe side&mdash;on to the level
ground, not over the precipice. A bump is a
bump, there's no denying it, but it's better than
<a class="pagenum" id="page_50" title="pg 50"></a>
a broken neck. Mrs. Freere took her bump
smiling, though it certainly hurt a little.</p>

<p>"Is she very pretty?"</p>

<p>He jumped up from the armchair. He was
highly serious about the matter, and that, perhaps,
may be counted a grace in him.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall do it&mdash;if I can. But I'm
hanged if I can talk to you about it!"</p>

<p>"That's rather nice of you. Thank you,
Harry."</p>

<p>He bowed his comely head, with its waving hair,
over her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Harry," she said.</p>

<p>He straightened himself and looked her in the
face for an instant. He shrugged his shoulders;
she understood and nodded. There was, in fact,
no saying what one's emotions would be up to
next&mdash;what would be the new commands of the
Restless and Savage Master. Poor Harry! She
knew his case. She herself had "taken him" from
her dear friend Rosa Hinde.</p>

<p>He was gone. She stood still by the mantelpiece
a moment longer, shrugged shoulders in her
turn&mdash;really that Savage Master!&mdash;crossed the
room to a looking-glass&mdash;not much wrong there
happily&mdash;and turned on the opening of the door.
Mr. Freere came in&mdash;between committees. He
had just time for a cup of tea.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_51" title="pg 51"></a>
"Just time, Wilson?"</p>

<p>"I've a committee at five, my dear."</p>

<p>She rang the bell. "Talk of road-hogs! You're
a committee-hog, you know."</p>

<p>He rubbed his bald head perplexedly. "They
accumulate," he pleaded in a puzzled voice. "I'm
sorry to leave you so much alone, my dear." He
came up to her and kissed her. "I always want
to be with you, Lily."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. She did know&mdash;and the
knowledge was one of the odd things in life.</p>

<p>"Goodness, I forgot to telephone!" He
hurried out of the room again.</p>

<p>"Serves me right, I suppose!" said Mrs.
Freere; to which of recent incidents she referred
must remain uncertain.</p>

<p>Mr. Freere came back for his hasty cup of tea.</p>

<p>The Park was gay in its spring bravery&mdash;a fine
setting for the play of elegance and luxury which
took place there on this as on every afternoon.
Harry Belfield sought to occupy and to distract
his mind by the spectacle, familiar though it was.
He did not want to congratulate himself on the
thing that had just happened, yet this was what
he found himself doing if he allowed his thoughts
to possess him. "That's over anyhow!" was the
spontaneous utterance of his feelings. Yet he felt
very mean. He did not see why, having done
<a class="pagenum" id="page_52" title="pg 52"></a>
the right thing, he should feel so mean. It seemed
somehow unfair&mdash;as though there were no pleasing
conscience, whatever one did. Conscience might
have retorted that in some situations there is no
"right thing;" there is a bold but fatal thing,
and there is a prudent but shabby thing; the right
thing has vanished earlier in the proceedings.
Still he had done the best thing open to him, and,
reflecting on that, he began to pluck up his spirits.
His sensuous nature turned to the pleasant side;
his volatile emotions forsook the past for the
future. As he walked along he began to hear
more plainly and to listen with less self-reproach
to the voice which had been calling him now for
many days&mdash;ever since he had addressed that
meeting in the Town Hall at Meriton. Meriton
was calling him back with the voice of Vivien
Wellgood, and with her eyes begging him to
hearken. He had "seen somebody," in Mrs.
Freere's sufficient phrase. Great and gay was
London, full of lures and charms; many were
they who were ready to pet, to spoil, and to
idolize; many there were to play, to laugh, and
to revel with. Potent must be the voice which
could draw him from all this! Yet he was
listening to it as he walked along. He was free
to listen to it now&mdash;free since he had left Mrs.
Freere's house in Grosvenor Street.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_53" title="pg 53"></a>
Suddenly he found himself face to face with
Andy Hayes&mdash;not a man he expected to meet in
Hyde Park at four o'clock in the afternoon. But
Andy explained that he had "knocked off early
at the shop" and come west, to have a last look
at the idle end of the town&mdash;everybody there
seemed idle, even if all were not.</p>

<p>"Because it's my last day in London. I'm
going down to Meriton to-morrow for the summer.
I've taken lodgings there&mdash;going to be an up-and-downer,"
Andy explained. "And I think I shall
generally be able to get Friday to Monday down
there."</p>

<p>To Meriton to-morrow! Harry suffered a
sharp and totally unmistakable pang of envy.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I believe you're right!" he
said. "I'm half sick of the racket of town. What's
the good of it all? And one gets through the
devil of a lot of money. And no time to do
anything worth doing! I don't believe I've
opened a book for a week."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you come down too? It
would be awfully jolly if you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not altogether easy to chuck everything
and everybody," Harry reminded his friend, who
did not seem to have reflected what a gap would
be caused by Mr. Harry Belfield's departure from
the metropolis. "Still I shall think about it.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_54" title="pg 54"></a>
I could get through a lot of work at home."
The historical and sociological reading obligingly
supplied an excellent motive for a flight from the
too-engrossing gaieties of town. "And, of course,
there's no harm in keeping an eye on the Division."
The potent voice was gathering allies
apace! Winning causes have that way. "I
might do much worse," Harry concluded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Andy was delighted. Harry's presence would
make Meriton a different place to him. He too,
for what he was worth (it is not possible to say
that he was worth very much in this matter),
became another ally of the potent voice, urging
the joys of country life and declaring that Harry
already looked "fagged out" by the arduous pleasures
of London life.</p>

<p>"I shall think about it seriously," said Harry,
knowing in himself that the voice had won. "Are
you doing anything to-night? I happen for once
to have an off evening."</p>

<p>"No; only I'd thought of dropping into the pit
somewhere. I haven't seen 'Hamlet' at the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh lord!" interrupted Harry. "Let's do
something a bit more cheerful than that! Have
you seen the girl at the Empire&mdash;the Nun? Not
seen her? Oh, you must! We'll dine at the club
and go; and I'll get her and another girl to come
<a class="pagenum" id="page_55" title="pg 55"></a>
on to supper. I'll give you a little fling for your
last night in town. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Will I come? I should rather think I would!"
cried Andy.</p>

<p>"All right; dinner at eight. We shall have
lots of time&mdash;she doesn't come on till nearly ten.
Meet me at the Artemis at eight. Till then, old
chap!" Harry darted after a lady who had
favoured him with a gracious bow as she passed
by, a moment before.</p>

<p>Here was an evening-out for Andy Hayes, whose
conscience had suggested "Hamlet" and whose
finances had dictated the pit. He went home to
his lodgings off Russell Square all smiles, and
spent a laborious hour trying to get the creases
out of his dress coat. "Well, I shall enjoy an
evening like that just for once," he said out
loud as he laboured.</p>

<p>"I've got her and another girl," Harry announced
when Andy turned up at the Artemis.
"The nuisance is that Billy Foot here insists on
coming too, so we shall be a man over. I've
told him I don't want him, but the fellow will
come."</p>

<p>"I'm certainly coming," said the tall long-faced
young man&mdash;for Billy Foot was still several years
short of forty&mdash;to whom Andy had listened with
such admiration at Meriton. In private life he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_56" title="pg 56"></a>
was not oppressively epigrammatic or logical, and
not at all ruthless; and everybody called him
"Billy," which in itself did much to deprive him
of his terrors.</p>

<p>The Artemis was a small and luxurious club
in King Street. Why it was called the "Artemis"
nobody knew. Billy Foot said that the name had
been chosen just because nobody would know
why it had been chosen&mdash;it was a bad thing, he
maintained, to label a club. Harry, however,
conjectured that the name indicated that the club
was half-way between the Athen&aelig;um and the
Turf&mdash;which you might take in the geographical
sense or in any other you pleased.</p>

<p>Andy ate of several foods that he had never
tasted before and drank better wine than he had
ever drunk before. His physique and his steady
brain made any moderate quantity of wine no
more than water to him. Harry Belfield, on the
contrary, responded felicitously to even his first
glass of champagne; his eyes grew bright and
his spirit gay. Any shadow cast over him by
his interview with Mrs. Freere was not long in
vanishing.</p>

<p>They enjoyed themselves so well that a cab had
only just time to land them at their place of entertainment
before the Nun, whose name was Miss
Doris Flower, came on the stage. She was having
<a class="pagenum" id="page_57" title="pg 57"></a>
a prodigious success because she did look like a
nun and sang songs that a nun might really be
supposed to sing&mdash;and these things, being quite
different from what the public expected, delighted
the public immensely. When Miss Flower, whose
performance was of high artistic merit, sang about
the baby which she might have had if she had not
been a nun, and in the second song (she was on
her death-bed in the second song, but this did not
at all impair her vocal powers) about the angel
whom she saw hovering over her bed, and the
angel's likeness to her baby sister who had died
in infancy, the public cried like a baby itself.</p>

<p>"Jolly good!" said Billy Foot, taking his cigar
out of his mouth and wiping away a furtive tear.
"But there, she is a ripper, bless her!" His tone
was distinctly affectionate.</p>

<p>But supper was the great event to Andy: that
was all new to him, and he took it in eagerly while
they waited for the Nun and her friend. Such a
din, such a chatter, such a lot of diamonds, such a
lot of smoke&mdash;and the white walls, the gilding, the
pink lampshades, the band ever and anon crashing
into a new tune, and the people shouting to make
themselves heard through it&mdash;Andy would have sat
on happily watching, even though he had got no
supper at all. Indeed he was no more hungry
than most of the other people there. One does
<a class="pagenum" id="page_58" title="pg 58"></a>
not go to supper there because one is hungry&mdash;that
is a vulgar reason for eating.</p>

<p>However supper he had, sitting between Billy
Foot and the Nun's friend, a young woman named
Miss Dutton, who had a critical, or even sardonic,
manner, but was extremely pretty. The Nun herself
contrived to be rather like a nun even off the
stage; she did not talk much herself, but listened
with an innocent smile to the sallies of Billy Foot
and Harry Belfield.</p>

<p>"Been to hear her?" Miss Dutton asked Andy.</p>

<p>Andy said that they had, and uttered words
of admiration.</p>

<p>"Sort of thing they like, isn't it?" said Miss
Dutton. "You can't put in too much rot for
them."</p>

<p>"But she sings it so&mdash;" Andy began to plead.</p>

<p>"Yes, she can sing. It's a wonder she's succeeded.
How sick one gets of this place!"</p>

<p>"Do you come often?"</p>

<p>"Every night&mdash;with her generally."</p>

<p>"I've never been here before in my life."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you like the look of us!"</p>

<p>Harry Belfield looked towards him. "Don't
mind what she says, Andy. We call her Sulky
Sally&mdash;don't we, Sally?&mdash;But she looks so nice
that we have to put up with her ways."</p>

<p>Miss Dutton smiled reluctantly, but evidently
<a class="pagenum" id="page_59" title="pg 59"></a>
could not help smiling at Harry. "I know the
value of your compliments," she remarked.
"There are plenty of them going about the
place to judge by!"</p>

<p>"Mercy, Sally, mercy! Don't show me up
before my friends!"</p>

<p>Miss Dutton busied herself with her supper.
The Nun ate little; most of the time she sat with
her pretty hands clasped on the table in front of
her. Suddenly she began to tell what proved to
be a rather long story about a man named Tommy&mdash;everybody
except Andy knew whom she meant.
She told this story in a low, pleasant, but somewhat
monotonous voice. In truth the Nun was
a trifle prolix and prosy, but she also looked so
nice that they were quite content to listen and to
look. It appeared that Tommy had done what
no man should do; he had made love to two
girls at once. For a long time all went well;
but one day Tommy, being away from the sources
of supply of cash (as a rule he transacted all his
business in notes), wrote two cheques&mdash;the Nun
specified the amounts, one being considerably
larger than the other&mdash;placed them in two envelopes,
and proceeded to address them wrongly.
Each lady got the other lady's cheque, and&mdash;"Well,
they wanted to know about it," said the Nun, with
a pensive smile. So, being acquaintances, they laid
<a class="pagenum" id="page_60" title="pg 60"></a>
their heads together, and the next time Tommy
(who had never discovered his mistake) asked lady
number one to dinner, she asked lady number two,
"and when Tommy arrived," said the Nun, "they
told him he'd find it cheaper that way, because
there'd only be one tip for the waiter!" The
Nun, having reached her point, gave a curiously
pretty little gurgle of laughter.</p>

<p>"Rather neat!" said Billy Foot. "And did
they chuck him?"</p>

<p>"They'd agreed to, but Maud weakened on it.
Nellie did."</p>

<p>"Poor old Tommy!" mused Harry Belfield.</p>

<p>It was not a story of surpassing merit whether it
were regarded from the moral or from the artistic
point of view; but the Nun had grown delighted
with herself as she told it, and her delight made
her look even more pretty. Andy could not keep
his eyes off her; she perceived his honest admiration
and smiled serenely at him across the table.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was Nellie who was to have the
small cheque?" Billy Foot suggested.</p>

<p>"No; it was Maud."</p>

<p>"Then I drink to Maud as a true woman and a
forgiving creature!"</p>

<p>Andy broke into a hearty enjoying laugh.
Nothing had passed which would stand a critical
examination in humour, much less in wit; but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_61" title="pg 61"></a>
Andy was very happy. He had never had such
a good time, never seen so many gay and pretty
women, never been so in touch with the holiday
side of life. The Nun delighted him; Miss
Dutton was a pleasantly acid pickle to stimulate
the palate for all this rich food. Billy Foot and
Harry looked at him, looked at one another, and
laughed.</p>

<p>"They're laughing at you," said Miss Dutton
in her most sardonic tone.</p>

<p>"I don't mind. Of course they are! I'm such
an outsider."</p>

<p>"Worth a dozen of either of them," she remarked,
with a calmly impersonal air that reduced
her compliment to a mere statement of fact.</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard!" cried Harry. "You don't
think much of us, do you, Sally?"</p>

<p>"I come here every night," said Miss Dutton.
"Consequently I know."</p>

<p>The pronouncement was so confident, so conclusive,
that there was nothing to do but laugh
at it. They all laughed. If you came there
every night, "consequently" you would know
many things!</p>

<p>"We must eat somewhere," observed the Nun
with placid resignation.</p>

<p>"We must be as good as we can and hope for
mercy," said Billy Foot.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_62" title="pg 62"></a>
"You'll need it," commented Miss Dutton.</p>

<p>"Let's hope the law of supply and demand will
hold good!" laughed Harry.</p>

<p>"How awfully jolly all this is!" said Andy.</p>

<p>He had just time to observe Miss Dutton's
witheringly patient smile before the lights went out.
"Hullo!" cried Andy; and the rest laughed.</p>

<p>Up again the lights went, but the Nun rose
from her chair.</p>

<p>"Had enough of it?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Nun with her simple, candid,
yet almost scornful directness. "Oh, it's been all
right. I like your friend, Harry&mdash;not Billy, of
course&mdash;the new one, I mean."</p>

<p>When they had got their cloaks and coats and
were waiting for the Nun's electric brougham,
Harry made an announcement that filled Andy
with joy and the rest of the company with
amazement.</p>

<p>"This is good-bye for a bit, Doris," he said.
"I'm off to the country the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What have we done to you?" the Nun inquired
with sedate anxiety.</p>

<p>"I've got to work, and I can't do it in London.
I've got a career to look after."</p>

<p>The Nun gurgled again&mdash;for the second time
only in the course of the evening. "Oh yes," she
murmured with obvious scepticism. "Well, come
<a class="pagenum" id="page_63" title="pg 63"></a>
and see me when you get back." She turned her
eyes to Andy, and, to his great astonishment, asked,
"Would you like to come too?"</p>

<p>Andy could hardly believe that he was himself,
but he had no doubt about his answer. The Nun
interested him very much, and was so very pretty.
"I should like to awfully," he replied.</p>

<p>"Come alone&mdash;not with these men, or we shall
only talk nonsense," said the Nun, as she got into
her brougham. "Get in, Sally."</p>

<p>"Where's the hurry?" asked Miss Dutton,
getting in nevertheless. The Nun slapped her
arm smartly; the two girls burst into a giggle,
and so went off.</p>

<p>"Where to now?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>Andy wondered what other place there was.</p>

<p>"Bed for me," said Billy Foot. "I've a
consultation at half-past nine, and I haven't opened
the papers yet."</p>

<p>"Bed is best," Harry agreed, though rather
reluctantly. "Going to take a cab, Billy?"</p>

<p>"What else is there to take?"</p>

<p>"Thought you might be walking."</p>

<p>"Oh, walking be &mdash;&mdash;!" He climbed into a
hansom.</p>

<p>"I'll walk with you, Harry. I haven't had
exercise enough."</p>

<p>Harry suggested that they should go home by
<a class="pagenum" id="page_64" title="pg 64"></a>
the Embankment. When they had cut down a
narrow street to it, he put his arm in Andy's and
led him across the road. They leant on the
parapet, looking at the river. The night was
fine, but hazy and still&mdash;a typical London night.</p>

<p>"You've given me a splendid evening," said
Andy. "And what a good sort those girls were!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harry, rather absently, "not a bad
sort. Doris has got her head on her shoulders,
and she's quite straight. Poor Sally's come one
awful cropper. She won't come another; she's
had more than enough of it. So one doesn't
mind her being a bit snarly."</p>

<p>Poor Sally! Andy had had no idea of anything
of the sort, but he had an instinct that people who
come one cropper&mdash;and one only&mdash;feel that one
badly.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling happy to-night, old fellow," said
Harry suddenly. "You may not happen to know
it, but I've gone it a bit for the last two or three
years, made rather a fool of myself, and&mdash;well, one
gets led on. Now I've made up my mind to chuck
all that. Some of it's all right&mdash;at any rate it
seems to happen; but I've had enough. I really
do want to work at the politics, you know."</p>

<p>"It's all before you, if you do," said Andy in
unquestioning loyalty.</p>

<p>"I'm going to work, and to pull up a bit all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_65" title="pg 65"></a>
round, and&mdash;" Harry broke off, but a smile was on
his lips. There on the bank of the Thames, fresh
from his party in the gay restaurant, he heard the
potent voice calling. It seemed to him that the
voice was potent enough not only to loose him
from Mrs. Freere, to lure him from London
delights, to carry him down to Meriton and peaceful
country life; but potent enough, too, to transform
him, to make him other than he was, to change
the nature that had till now been his very self. He
appealed from passion to passion; from the soiled
to the clean, from the turgid to the clear. A new
desire of his eyes was to make a new thing of his
life.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV.<a class="pagenum" id="page_66" title="pg 66"></a></h2>

<h2>SETTLED PROGRAMMES.</h2>

<p>Mark Wellgood of Nutley had a bugbear,
an evil thing to which he gave the name of
sentimentality. Wherever he saw it he hated it&mdash;and
he saw it everywhere. No matter what was
the sphere of life, there was the enemy ready to
raise its head, and Mark Wellgood ready to hit that
head. In business and in public affairs he warred
against it unceasingly; in other people's religion&mdash;he
had very little of his own&mdash;he was keen to
denounce it; even from the most intimate family
and personal relationships he had always been
resolved to banish it, or, failing that, to suppress its
manifestations. Himself a man of uncompromising
temper and strong passions, he saw in this hated
thing the root of all the vices with which he had
least sympathy. It made people cowards who
shrank from manfully taking their own parts; it
made them hypocrites who would not face the facts
of human nature and human society, but sought to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_67" title="pg 67"></a>
cover up truths that they would have called "ugly"
by specious names, by veils, screens, and fine paraphrases.
It made men soft, women childish, and
politicians flabby; it meant sheer ruin to a nation.</p>

<p>Sentimentality was, of course, at the bottom of
what was the matter with his daughter, of those
things of which, with the aid of Isobel Vintry's
example, he hoped to cure her&mdash;her timidity and
her fastidiousness. But it was at the bottom of
much more serious things than these&mdash;since to make
too much fuss about a girl's nonsensical fancies
would be sentimental in himself. Notably it was
at the bottom of all shades of opinion from
Liberalism to Socialism, both included. Harry
Belfield, lunching at Nutley a week or so after
his return to Meriton, had the benefit of these
views, with which, as a prospective Conservative
candidate, he was confidently expected to sympathise.</p>

<p>"I've only one answer to make to a Socialist,"
said Wellgood. "I say to him, 'You can have my
property when you're strong enough to take it.
Until then, you can't.' Under democracy we count
heads instead of breaking them. It's a bad system,
but it's tolerable as long as the matter isn't worth
fighting about. When you come to vital issues,
it'll break down&mdash;it always has. We, the governing
classes, shall keep our position and our property
<a class="pagenum" id="page_68" title="pg 68"></a>
just as long as we're able and willing to defend
them. If the Socialists mean business, they'd
better stop talking and learn to shoot."</p>

<p>"That might be awkward for us," said Harry,
with a smile at Vivien opposite.</p>

<p>"But if they think we're going to sit still and be
voted out of everything, they're much mistaken.
That's what I hope, at all events, though it needs a
big effort not to despair of the country sometimes.
People won't look at the facts of nature. All
nature's a fight from beginning to end. All through,
the strong hold down the weak; and the strong
grow stronger by doing it&mdash;never mind whether
they're men or beasts."</p>

<p>"There's a lot of truth in that; but I don't
know that it would be very popular on a platform&mdash;even
on one of ours!"</p>

<p>"You political fellows have to wrap it up, I
suppose, but the cleverer heads among the working
men know all about it&mdash;trust them! They're on
the make themselves; they want to get where we
are; gammoning the common run helps towards
that. Oh, they're not sentimental! I do them the
justice to believe that."</p>

<p>"But isn't there a terrible lot of misery, father?"
asked Vivien.</p>

<p>"You can't cure misery by quackery, my dear,"
he answered concisely. "Half of it's their own
<a class="pagenum" id="page_69" title="pg 69"></a>
fault, and for the rest&mdash;hasn't there always been?
So long as some people are weaker than others,
they'll fare worse. I don't see any particular
attraction in the idea of making weaklings or
cowards as comfortable as the strong and the
brave." His glance at his daughter was stern.
Vivien flushed a little; the particular ordeal of that
morning, a cross-country ride with her father, had
not been a brilliant success.</p>

<p>"To him that hath shall be given, eh?" Harry
suggested.</p>

<p>"Matter of Scripture, Harry, and you can't get
away from it!" said Wellgood with a laugh.</p>

<p>Psychology is not the strong point of a mind
like Wellgood's. To study his fellow-creatures
curiously seems to such a man rather unnecessary
and rather twaddling work; in its own sphere it
corresponds to the hated thing itself, to an over-scrupulous
worrying about other people's feelings
or even about your own. It had not occurred to
Wellgood to study Harry Belfield. He liked him,
as everybody did, and he had no idea how vastly
Harry's temperament differed from his own. Harry
had many material guarantees against folly&mdash;his
birth, the property that was to be his, the career
opening before him. If Wellgood saw any signs
of what he condemned, he set them down to youth
and took up the task of a mentor with alacrity.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_70" title="pg 70"></a>
Moreover he was glad to have Harry coming to
the house; matters were still at an early stage, but
if there were a purpose in his coming, there was
nothing to be said against the project. He would
welcome an alliance with Halton, and it would be
an alliance on even terms; for Vivien had some
money of her own, apart from what he could leave
her. Whether she would have Nutley or not&mdash;well,
that was uncertain. Wellgood was only forty-three
and young for his years; he might yet marry
and have a son. A second marriage was more than
an idea in his head; it was an intention fully
formed. The woman he meant to ask to be his
wife at the suitable moment lived in his house and
sat at his table with him&mdash;his daughter's companion,
Isobel Vintry.</p>

<p>Isobel had sat silent through Wellgood's talk,
not keenly interested in the directly political aspect
of it, but appreciating the view of human nature
and of the way of the world which underlay it.
She also was on the side of the efficient&mdash;of the
people who knew what they wanted and at any rate
made a good fight to get it. Yet while she listened
to Wellgood, her eyes had often been on Harry;
she too was beginning to ask why Harry came so
much to Nutley; the obvious answer filled her
with a vague stirring of discontent. An ambitious
self-confident nature does not like to be "counted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_71" title="pg 71"></a>
out," to be reckoned out of the running before the
race is fairly begun. Why was the answer obvious?
There was more than one marriageable young
woman at Nutley. Her feeling of protest was
still vague; but it was there, and when she looked
at Harry's comely face, her eyes were thoughtful.</p>

<p>Though Wellgood had business after lunch,
Harry stayed on awhile, sitting out on the terrace
by the lake, for the day was warm and fine. The
coming of spring had mitigated the grimness of
Nutley; the water that had looked dreary and
dismal in the winter now sparkled in the sun.
Harry was excellently well content with himself
and his position. He told the two girls that things
were shaping very well. Old Sir George Millington
had decided to retire. He was to be the candidate;
he would start his campaign through the villages of
the Division in the late summer, when harvest was
over; he could hardly be beaten; and he was
"working like a horse" at his subjects.</p>

<p>"The horse gets out of harness now and then!"
said Isobel.</p>

<p>"You don't want him to kill himself with work,
Isobel?" asked Vivien reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Visits to Nutley help the work; they inspire
me," Harry declared, looking first at Vivien, then
at Isobel. They were both, in their different ways,
pleasant to look at. Their interest in him&mdash;in all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_72" title="pg 72"></a>
he said and did, and in all he was going to do&mdash;was
very pleasant also.

"Oh yes, I'm working all right!" he laughed.
"Really I have to, because of old Andy Hayes.
He's getting quite keen on politics&mdash;reads all the
evening after he gets back from town. Well, he's
good enough to think I've read everything and
know everything, and whenever we meet he pounds
me with questions. I don't want Andy to catch
me out, so I have to mug away."</p>

<p>"That's your friend, Vivien," said Isobel, with
a smile and a nod.</p>

<p>"Yes, the solid man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that story. Andy told me himself.
He thought you behaved like a brick."</p>

<p>"He did, anyhow. Why don't you bring him
here, Harry?"</p>

<p>"He's in town all day; I'll try and get him
here some Saturday."</p>

<p>"Does he still stay with the&mdash;with Mr. Rock?"
asked Vivien.</p>

<p>"No; he's taken lodgings. He's very thick
with old Jack still, though. Of course it wouldn't
do to tell him so, but it's rather a bore that he
should be connected with Jack in that way. It
doesn't make my mother any keener to have him
at Halton, and it's a little difficult for me to
press it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_73" title="pg 73"></a>
"It does make his position seem&mdash;just rather
betwixt and between, doesn't it?" asked Isobel.</p>

<p>"If only it wasn't a butcher!" protested Vivien.</p>

<p>"O Vivien, the rules, the rules!" "Nothing
against butchers," was one of the rules.</p>

<p>"I know, but I would so much rather it had
been a draper, or a stationer, or something&mdash;something
clean of that sort."</p>

<p>"I'm glad your father's not here. Be good,
Vivien!"</p>

<p>"However it's not so bad if he doesn't stay
there any more," Harry charitably concluded.
"Just going in for a drink with old Jack&mdash;everybody
does that; and after all he's no blood
relation." He laughed. "Though I dare say
that's exactly what you'd call him, Vivien."</p>

<p>Just as he made his little joke Vivien had risen.
It was her time for "doing the flowers," one of
the few congenial tasks allowed her. She smiled
and blushed at Harry's hit at her, looking very
charming. Harry indulged himself in a glance
of bold admiration. It made her cheeks redder
still as she turned away, Harry looking after her
till she rounded the corner of the house. In
answering the call of the voice he had found
no disappointment. Closer and more intimate
acquaintance revealed her as no less charming
than she had promised to be. Harry was sure
<a class="pagenum" id="page_74" title="pg 74"></a>
now of what he wanted, and remained quite sure
of all the wonderful things that it was going to
do for him and for his life.</p>

<p>Suddenly on the top of all this legitimate and
proper feeling&mdash;to which not even Mark Wellgood
himself could object, since it was straight
in the way of nature&mdash;there came on Harry
Belfield a sensation rare, yet not unknown, in his
career&mdash;a career still so short, yet already so
emotionally eventful.</p>

<p>Isobel Vintry was not looking at him&mdash;she
was gazing over the lake&mdash;nor he at her; he
was engaged in the process of lighting a cigarette.
Yet he became intensely aware of her, not merely
as one in his company, but as a being who influenced
him, affected him, in some sense stretched
out a hand to him. He gave a quick glance at
her; she was motionless, her eyes still aloof from
him. He stirred restlessly in his chair; the air
seemed very close and heavy. He wanted to
make some ordinary, some light remark; for the
moment it did not come. A remembrance of
the first time that Mrs. Freere and he had passed
the bounds of ordinary friendship struck across
his mind, unpleasantly, and surely without relevance!
Isobel had said nothing, had done
nothing, nor had he. Yet it was as though some
mystic sign had passed from her to him&mdash;he could
<a class="pagenum" id="page_75" title="pg 75"></a>
not tell whether from him to her also&mdash;a sign
telling that, whatever circumstances might do,
there was in essence a link between them, a
reminder from her that she too was a woman,
that she too had her power. He did not doubt
that she was utterly unconscious, but neither did
he believe that he was solely responsible, that he
had merely imagined. There was an atmosphere
suddenly formed&mdash;an atmosphere still and heavy
as the afternoon air that brooded over the unruffled
lake.</p>

<p>Harry had no desire to abide in it. His mind
was made up; his heart was single. He picked
up a stone which had been swept from somewhere
on to the terrace and pitched it into the lake.
A plop, and many ripples. The heavy stillness
was broken.</p>

<p>Isobel turned to him with a start.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to sleep, Miss
Vintry. I couldn't think of anything to say, so
I threw a stone into the water. I'm afraid you
were finding me awfully dull!"</p>

<p>"You dull! You're a change from what sometimes
does seem a little dull&mdash;life at Nutley.
But perhaps you can't conceive life at Nutley
being dull?" Her eyes mocked him with the
hint that she had discovered his secret.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I should be rather hard to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_76" title="pg 76"></a>
please if I found Nutley dull," he said gaily.
"But if you do, why do you stay?"</p>

<p>"Perpetual amusement isn't in a companion's
contract, Mr. Harry. Besides, I'm fond of Vivien.
I should be sorry to leave her before the natural
end of my stay comes."</p>

<p>"The natural end?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you understand that." She smiled
with a good-humoured scorn at his homage to
pretence.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, girls do marry. It's been
known to happen," said Harry, neither "cornered"
nor embarrassed. "But perhaps"&mdash;he glanced
at her, wondering whether to risk a snub. His
charm, his gift of gay impudence, had so often
stood him in stead and won him a liberty that
a heavy-handed man could not hope to be allowed;
he was not much afraid&mdash;"Perhaps you'd be asked
to stay on&mdash;in another capacity, Miss Vintry."</p>

<p>"It looks as if your thoughts were running on
such things." She did not affect not to understand,
but she was not easy to corner either.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they always have been," Harry confessed,
a confession without much trace of penitence.</p>

<p>"Mine don't often; and they're never supposed
to&mdash;in my position."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Really that doesn't go down,
Miss Vintry. Why, a girl like you, with such&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_77" title="pg 77"></a>
"Don't attempt a catalogue, please, Mr. Harry."</p>

<p>"You're right, quite right. I'm conscious how
limited my powers are."</p>

<p>Harry Belfield could no more help this sort
of thing than a bird can help flying. In childhood
he had probably lisped in compliments, as the poet
in numbers. In itself it was harmless, even graceful,
and quite devoid of serious meaning. Yet it
was something new in his relations with Isobel
Vintry; though it had arisen out of a desire to
dispel that mysterious atmosphere, yet it was a
sequel to it. Hitherto she had been Vivien's
companion. In that brief session of theirs&mdash;alone
together by the lake&mdash;she had assumed an independent
existence for him, a vivid, distinctive,
rather compelling one. The impressionable mind
received a new impression, the plastic feelings
suffered the moulding of a fresh hand. Harry,
who was alert to watch himself and always knew
when he was interested, was telling himself that
she was such a notable foil to Vivien; that was
why he was interested. Vivien was still the centre
of gravity. The explanation vindicated his interest,
preserved his loyalty, and left his resolve unshaken.
These satisfactory effects were all on himself; the
idea of effects on Isobel Vintry did not occur to
him. He was not vain, he was hardly a conscious
or intentional "lady-killer." He really suffered
<a class="pagenum" id="page_78" title="pg 78"></a>
love affairs rather than sought them; he was
driven into them by an overpowering instinct to
prove his powers. He could not help "playing
the game"&mdash;the rather hazardous game&mdash;to the
full extent of his natural ability. That extent was
very considerable.</p>

<p>He said good-bye to her, laughingly declaring
that after all he would prepare a catalogue, and
send it to her by post. Then he went into the
house, to find Vivien and pay another farewell.
Left alone, Isobel rose from her chair with an
abrupt and impatient movement. She was a
woman of feelings not only more mature but
far stronger than Vivien's; she had ambitious
yearnings which never crossed Vivien's simple
soul. But she was stern with herself. Perhaps
she had caught and unconsciously copied some
of Wellgood's anti-sentimental attitude. She
often told herself that the feelings were merely
dangerous and the yearnings silly. Yet when
others seemed tacitly to accept that view, made
no account of her, and assumed to regard her
place in life as settled, she glowed with a deep
resentment against them, crying that she would
make herself felt. To-day she knew that somehow,
to some degree however small, she had
made herself felt by Harry Belfield. The discovery
could not be said to bring pleasure, but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_79" title="pg 79"></a>
it brought triumph&mdash;triumph and an oppressive
restlessness.</p>

<p>Wellgood strolled out of the house and joined
her. "Where's Harry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He went into the house to say good-bye to
Vivien; or perhaps he's gone altogether by now."</p>

<p>Wellgood stood in thought, his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>"He's a bit inclined to be soft, but I think we
shall make a man of him. He's got a great
chance, anyhow. Vivien seems to like him,
doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody must!" She smiled at him.
"Are you thinking of match-making, like a good
father?"</p>

<p>"She might do worse, and I'd like her to marry
a man we know all about. The poor child hasn't
backbone to stand up for herself if she happened
on a rascal."</p>

<p>Isobel had a notion that Wellgood was over-confident
if he assumed that he, or they, knew
all about Harry Belfield. His parentage, his
position, his prospects&mdash;yes. Did these exhaust
the subject? But Wellgood's downright mind
would have seen only "fancies" in such a
suggestion.</p>

<p>"If that's the programme, I must begin to think
of packing up my trunks," she said with a laugh.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_80" title="pg 80"></a>
He did not join in her laugh, but his stern lips
relaxed into a smile. "Lots of time to think
about that," he told her, his eyes seeming to
make a careful inspection of her. "Nutley would
hardly be itself without you, Isobel."</p>

<p>She showed no sign of embarrassment under
his scrutiny; she stood handsome and apparently
serene in her composure.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor Nutley would soon recover from
the blow," she said. "But I shall be sorry to
go. You've been very kind to me."</p>

<p>"You've done your work very well. People
who work well are well treated at Nutley; people
who work badly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aren't exactly petted? No, they're not, Mr.
Wellgood, I know."</p>

<p>"You'd always do your work, whatever it might
be, well, so you'd always be well treated."</p>

<p>"At any rate you'll give me a good character?"
she asked mockingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll see that you get a good place," he
answered her in the same tone, but with a hint
of serious meaning in his eyes.</p>

<p>His plan was quite definite, his confidence in the
issue of it absolute. But "one thing at a time"
was among his maxims. He would like to see
Vivien's affair settled before his own was undertaken.
His idea was that his declaration and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_81" title="pg 81"></a>
acceptance should follow on his daughter's engagement.</p>

<p>Isobel was not afraid of Mark Wellgood, as
his daughter was, and as so many women would
have been. She had a self-confidence equal to
his own; she added to it a subtlety which would
secure her a larger share of independence than
it would be politic to claim openly. She had not
feared him as a master, and would not fear him
as a husband. Moreover she understood him far
better than he read her. Understanding gives
power. And she liked him; there was much
that was congenial to her in his mind and modes
of thought. He was a man, a strong man. But
the prospect at which his words hinted&mdash;she was
not blind to their meaning, and for some time
back had felt little doubt of his design&mdash;did not
enrapture her. At first sight it seemed that it
ought. She had no money, her family were poor,
marriage was her only chance of independence.
Nutley meant both a comfort and a status beyond
her reasonable hopes. But it meant also an end
to the ambitious dreams. It was finality. Just
this life she led now for all her life&mdash;or at least
all Wellgood's! He was engrossed in the occupations
of a country gentleman of moderate means,
in his estate work and his public work. He
hardly ever went to London; he never travelled
<a class="pagenum" id="page_82" title="pg 82"></a>
farther afield; he visited little even among his
neighbours. Some of these habits a wife might
modify; the essentials of the life she would hardly
be able to change. Yet, if she got the chance,
there was no question but that she ought to take
it. Common sense told her that, just as it told
Wellgood that it would be absurd to doubt of
her acceptance.</p>

<p>Common sense might say what it liked. Her
feelings were in revolt, and their insurrection
gathered fresh strength to-day. It was not so
much that Wellgood was nearly twenty years her
senior. That counted, but not as heavily as
perhaps might be expected, since his youthful
vigour was still all his. It was the certainty
with which his thoughts disposed of her, his
assumption that his suit would be free from
difficulty and from rivalry, his matter-of-course
conclusion that Harry could come to Nutley only
for Vivien's sake. If these things wounded her
woman's pride, the softer side of her nature
lamented the absence of romance, of the thrill
of love, of being wooed and won in some poetic
fashion, of everything&mdash;she found her thoughts
insensibly taking this direction&mdash;that it would be
for Harry Belfield's chosen mistress to enjoy.
Nobody&mdash;least of all the man who was content
to take her to wife himself&mdash;seemed to think of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_83" title="pg 83"></a>
her as a choice even possible to Harry. He was,
of course, for Vivien. All the joys of love, all
the life of pleasure, the participation in his career,
the moving many-coloured existence to be led
by his side&mdash;all these were for Vivien. Her
heart cried out in protest at the injustice; she
might not even have her chance! It would be
counted treachery if she strove for it, if she
sought to attract Harry or allowed herself to be
attracted by him. She had to stand aside; she
was to be otherwise disposed of, her assent to the
arrangement being asked so confidently that it
could hardly be said to be asked at all. Suppose
she did not assent? Suppose she fought for
herself, treachery or no treachery? Suppose she
followed the way of her feelings, if so be that
they led her towards Harry Belfield? Suppose
she put forth what strength she had to upset
Wellgood's plan, to fight for herself?</p>

<p>She played with these questions as she walked
up and down the terrace by the lake. She declared
to herself that she was only playing with them, but
they would not leave her.</p>

<p>Certainly the questions found no warrant in
Harry Belfield's present mood. He had made
up his mind, his eager blood was running apace.
That very evening, as his father and he sat alone
together after dinner, in the long room graced by
<a class="pagenum" id="page_84" title="pg 84"></a>
the two Vandykes which were the boast of Halton,
he broached the matter in confidence. Mr. Belfield
was a frail man of sixty. He had always been
delicate in health, a sufferer from asthma and
prone to chills; but he was no acknowledged
invalid, and would not submit to the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. He
did his share of county work; his judgment was
highly esteemed, his sense of honour strict and
scrupulous. He had a dryly humorous strain in
him, which found food for amusement in his son's
exuberant feelings and dashing impulses, without
blinding him to their dangers.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not a great match, but it's quite
satisfactory, Harry. You'll find no opposition
here. I like her very much, and your mother
does too, I know. But"&mdash;he smiled and lifted
his brows&mdash;"it's a trifle sudden, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sudden?" cried Harry. "Why, I've known
her all my life!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you haven't been in love with her
all your life. And, if report speaks true, you
have been in love with some other women."
Mr. Belfield was a man of the world; his tone
was patient and not unduly severe as he referred
to Harry's adventures of the heart, which had
reached his ears from friends in London.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Harry; "but those were
only&mdash;well, passing sort of things, you know."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_85" title="pg 85"></a>
"And this isn't a passing sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; I'm dead sure of it. Well,
a fellow can't tell another&mdash;not even his father&mdash;what
he feels."</p>

<p>"No, no, don't try; keep all that for the lady.
But if I were you I'd go a bit slow, and I wouldn't
tell your mother yet. There's no particular hurry,
is there?"</p>

<p>Harry laughed. "Well, I suppose that depends
on how one feels. I happen to feel rather in a
hurry."</p>

<p>"Go as slow as you can. Passing things pass:
a wife's a more permanent affair. And undoing
a mistake is neither a very easy nor a very savoury
business."</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely sure. Still I'll try to wait and
see if I can manage to get a little bit surer still,
just to please you, pater."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old boy; I don't think you'll
repent it. And, after all, it may be as well to
give the lady time to get quite sure too&mdash;eh?"
His eyes twinkled. He was fully aware that
Harry would not think a great deal of time necessary
for that. "Oh, by-the-bye," he went on,
"I've a little bit of good news for you. I've
interceded with your mother on Andy Hayes'
behalf, and her heart is softened. She says she'll
be very glad to see him here&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_86" title="pg 86"></a>
"Hurrah! That's very good of the mater."</p>

<p>"&mdash;when we're alone, or have friends who we
know won't object." He laughed a little, and
Harry joined in the laugh. "A prudent woman's
prudent provisoes, Harry! I wish both you and
I were as wise as your mother is."</p>

<p>"Dear old Andy&mdash;he's getting quite the fashion!
I'm to take him to Nutley too."</p>

<p>"Excellent! Because it looks as if Nutley
would be coming here to a certain extent in the
immediate future, and he'll be able to come when
Nutley does." He rose from his chair. "My
throat's bothersome to-night; I'll leave you alone
with your cigarette."</p>

<p>Harry smoked a cigarette that seemed to emit
clouds of rosy smoke. All that lay in the past
was forgotten; the future beckoned him to glittering
joys.</p>

<p>"Marriage is his best chance, but even that's a
considerable chance with Master Harry!" thought
his father as he sat down to his book.</p>

<p>The one man who had serious fears&mdash;or at least
doubts&mdash;about Harry Belfield's future was his own
father.</p>

<p>"I probably shan't live to see the trouble, if
any comes," he thought. "And if his mother
does&mdash;she won't believe it's his fault."</p>

<h2>Chapter V.<a class="pagenum" id="page_87" title="pg 87"></a></h2>

<h2>BROADENING LIFE.</h2>

<p>"Five all, and deuce!" cried Wellgood, who
had taken on himself the function of
umpire. He turned to Isobel and Vivien, who
sat by in wicker armchairs, watching the game.
"I never thought it would be so close. Hayes
has pulled up wonderfully!"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Hayes'll win now," said Vivien.</p>

<p>An "exhibition single" was being played, by
request, before the audience above indicated.
Andy Hayes had protested that, though of course
he would play if they wished, he could not give
Harry a game&mdash;he had not played for more than
a year. At first it looked as if he were right:
Harry romped away with the first four games, so
securely superior that he fired friendly chaff at
Andy's futile rushes across the court in pursuit
of a ball skilfully placed where he least expected
it. But in the fifth game the rallies became very
long; Andy was playing for safety&mdash;playing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_88" title="pg 88"></a>
deadly safe. He did not try to kill; Harry did,
but often committed suicide. The fifth, the sixth,
the seventh game went to Andy. A flash of
brilliancy gave Harry the eighth&mdash;five, three!
The ninth was his service&mdash;he should have had
it, and the set. Andy's returns were steady, low,
all good length, possible to return, almost impossible
to kill. But Harry tried to kill. Four,
five. Andy served, and found a "spot"&mdash;at least
Harry's malevolent glances at a particular piece
of turf implied a theory that he had. Five all!
And now "Deuce"!</p>

<p>"He's going to lick me, see if he isn't!" cried
Harry Belfield, perfectly good-natured, but not
hiding his opinion that such a result would be
paradoxical.</p>

<p>Andy felt terribly ashamed of himself&mdash;he
wanted to win so much. To play Harry Belfield
on equal terms and beat him, just for once!
This spirit of emulation was new to his soul; it
seemed rather alarming when it threatened his
old-time homage in all things to Harry. Where
was ambition going to stop? None the less,
eye and hand had no idea of not doing their best.
A slashing return down the side line and a clever
lob gave him the game&mdash;six, five!</p>

<p>Harry Belfield was the least bit vexed&mdash;amusedly
vexed. He remembered Andy's clumsy elephantine
<a class="pagenum" id="page_89" title="pg 89"></a>
sprawlings (no other word for them) about the
court when in their boyhood he had first undertaken
to teach him the game. Andy must have
played a lot in Canada.</p>

<p>"Now I'll take three off you, Andy," he
cried, and served a double fault. The "gallery"
laughed. "Oh, damn it!" exclaimed Harry,
indecorously loud, and served another. Andy
could not help laughing&mdash;the first time he had
ever laughed at Harry Belfield. Given a handicap
of thirty, the game was, barring extraordinary
accidents, his. So it proved. He won it at forty-fifteen,
with a stroke that a child ought to have
returned; Harry put it into the net.</p>

<p>"Lost your nerve, Harry?" said the umpire.</p>

<p>"The beggar's such a sticker!" grumbled
Harry, laughing. "You think you've got him
licked&mdash;and you haven't!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad Mr. Hayes won." This from Vivien.</p>

<p>"Not only defeated, but forsaken!" Harry
cried. "Andy, I'll have your blood!"</p>

<p>Andy Hayes laughed joyously. This victory
came as an unlooked-for adornment to a day
already notable. A Saturday half-holiday, down
from town in time to lunch at Nutley, tennis
and tea, and the prospect (not free from piquant
alarm) of dinner at Halton&mdash;this was a day for
Andy Hayes! With an honest vanity&mdash;a vanity
<a class="pagenum" id="page_90" title="pg 90"></a>
based on true affection&mdash;he thought how the account
of it would tickle Jack Rock. His life
seemed broadening out before him, and he would
like to tell dear old Jack all about it. Playing
lawn-tennis at Nutley, dining at Halton&mdash;here
were things just as delightful, just as enlightening,
as supping at the great restaurant in the company
of the Nun and pretty sardonic Miss Dutton.
He owed them all to Harry&mdash;he almost wished he
had lost the set. At any rate he felt that he ought
to wish it.</p>

<p>"It was an awful fluke!" he protested apologetically.</p>

<p>"You'd beat him three times out of five,"
Wellgood asserted in that confident tone of his.</p>

<p>Harry looked a little vexed. He bore an occasional
defeat with admirable good-nature: to be
judged consistently inferior was harder schooling
to his temper. Triumphing in whatever the contest
might be had grown into something of a
custom with him. It brooked occasional breaches:
abrogation was another matter. But "Oh no!"
cried both the girls together.</p>

<p>Harry was on his feet again in a moment.
Women's praise was always sweet to him, and
not the less sweet for being open to a suspicion
of partiality&mdash;which is, after all, a testimony to
achievement in other fields.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_91" title="pg 91"></a>
Such a partiality accounted for the conviction
of Harry's superiority in Vivien's case at least.
She had grown up in the midst of the universal
Meriton adoration of him as the most accomplished,
the kindest, the merriest son of that soil,
the child of promise, the present pride and the
future glory of his native town. Any facts or
reports not to the credit of the idol or reflecting
on his divinity had not reached her cloistered ears.
Wellgood, like Harry's own father, had heard
some, but Wellgood held common-sense views
even more fully than Mr. Belfield; facts were
facts, and all men had to be young for a time.
Now, if signs were to be trusted, if the idol's own
words, eyes, and actions meant what she could
not but deem they meant (or where stood the
idol's honesty?), he proposed to ask her to share
his throne; he, the adored, offered adoration&mdash;an
adoration on a basis of reciprocity, be it understood.
She did not grumble at that. To give
was so easy, so inevitable; to receive&mdash;to be asked
to accept&mdash;so wonderful. It could not enter her
head or her heart to question the value of the
gift or to doubt the whole-heartedness with which
it was bestowed. It was to her so great a thing
that she held it must be as great to Harry. Really
at the present moment it was as great to Harry.
His courtship of her seemed a very great thing,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_92" title="pg 92"></a>
his absolute exclusive devotion a rare flower of
romance.</p>

<p>But she had been glad to see Andy win. Oh
yes, she was compassionate. She knew so well
what it was not to do things as cleverly as other
people, and how oppressive it felt to be always
inferior. Besides Andy had a stock of gratitude
to draw on; somehow he had, by his solidity,
caused Curly to appear far less terrible. With
a genuine gladness she saw him pluck one leaf
from Harry's wreath. It must mean so much to
Mr. Hayes; it mattered nothing to Harry. Nay,
rather, it was an added chance for his graces of
manner to shine forth.</p>

<p>They did shine forth. "Very good of you,
ladies, but I think he holds me safe," said Harry.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't if you'd only play steady," Andy
observed in his reflective way. "Taking chances&mdash;that's
your fault, Harry."</p>

<p>"Taking chances&mdash;why, it's life!" cried Harry,
any shadow of vexation utterly gone and leaving
not the smallest memory.</p>

<p>"Well, ordinary people can't look at it like
that," Andy said, with no touch of sarcasm, amply
acknowledging that Harry and the ordinary were
things remote from one another.</p>

<p>Was life taking chances? To one only of the
party did that seem really true. Harry had said
<a class="pagenum" id="page_93" title="pg 93"></a>
it, but he was not the one. He was possessed
by a new triumphant certainty; Wellgood by the
thought of a mastery he deemed already established,
and waiting only for his word to be
declared; Vivien by a dream that glowed and
glittered, refusing too close a touch with earth;
Andy by a stout conviction that he must not think
about chances, but work away at his timber (he
still called it lumber in his inner mind) and his
books, pausing only to thank heaven for a wonderful
Saturday holiday.</p>

<p>But life was taking chances! Supine in her
chair, silent since her one exclamation in championship
of Harry Belfield, Isobel Vintry echoed the
cry. Life was taking chances? Yes, any life
worth having perhaps was. But what if the
chances did not come one's way? Who can take
what fate never offers?</p>

<p>All the present party was to meet again at
Halton in the evening. It seemed hardly a separation
when Harry and Andy started off together
towards Meriton, Harry, as usual, chattering
briskly, Andy listening, considering, absorbing.
At a turn of the road they passed two old friends
of his, Wat Money, the lawyer's clerk, and Tom
Dove, the budding publican&mdash;"Chinks" and "The
Bird" of days of yore.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Harry! Hullo, Andy!"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_94" title="pg 94"></a>
said Chinks and the Bird. When they were past,
the Bird nudged Chinks with his elbow and winked
his eye.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's getting no end of a swell, isn't
he?" said Chinks. "Hand-and-glove with Harry
Belfield!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't see much of those chaps
now?" Harry was asking Andy at the same
moment. There was just a shadow of admonition
in the question.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't. Well, we're all at work.
And when I do get a day off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't need to spend it at the Lion!"
laughed Harry. "As good drink and better company
in other places!"</p>

<p>There were certainly good things to drink and
eat at Halton, and Andy could not be blamed if he
found the company at least as well to his liking.
He had not been there since he was quite a small
boy&mdash;in the days before Nancy Rock migrated
from the house next the butcher's shop in High
Street to preside over his home&mdash;but he had never
forgotten the handsome dining-room with its two
Vandykes, nor the glass of sherry which Mr.
Belfield had once given him there. Mrs. Belfield
received him with graciousness, Mr. Belfield with
cordiality. Of course he was the first to arrive,
being very fearful of unpunctuality. Even Harry
<a class="pagenum" id="page_95" title="pg 95"></a>
was not down yet. Not being able, for obvious
reasons, to ask after her guest's relations&mdash;her
invariable way, when it was possible, of opening a
conversation&mdash;Mrs. Belfield expressed her pleasure
at seeing him back in Meriton.</p>

<p>"My husband thinks you're such a good companion
for Harry," she added, showing that her
pleasure was genuine, even if somewhat interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hayes," said Mr. Belfield. "See all you
can of him; we shall be grateful. He wants just
what a steady-going sensible fellow, as everybody
says you are, can give him&mdash;a bit of ballast, eh?"</p>

<p>"Everybody" had been, in fact, Jack Rock,
but&mdash;again for obvious reasons&mdash;the authority was
not cited by name.</p>

<p>"You may be sure I shall give him as much of
my company as he'll take, sir," said Andy, infinitely
pleased, enormously complimented.</p>

<p>Placidity was Mrs. Belfield's dominant note&mdash;a
soothing placidity. She was rather short and
rather plump&mdash;by no means an imposing figure;
but this quality gave her a certain dignity, and
even a certain power in her little world. People
let her have her own way because she was so
placidly sure that they would, and it seemed
almost profane to disturb the placidity. Even her
husband's humour was careful to stop short of
that. Her physical movements were in harmony
<a class="pagenum" id="page_96" title="pg 96"></a>
with her temper&mdash;leisurely, smooth, noiseless; her
voice was gentle, low, and even. She seemed to
Andy to fit in well with the life she lived and
always had lived, to be a good expression or
embodiment of its sheltered luxury and sequestered
tranquillity. Storms and stress and struggles&mdash;these
things had nothing to do with Mrs. Belfield,
and really ought to have none; they would be
quite out of keeping with her. She seemed to
have a right to ask that things about her should
go straight and go quietly. There was perhaps
a flavour of selfishness about this disposition;
certainly an inaccessibility to strong feeling. For
instance, while placidly assuming Harry's success
and Harry's career, she was not excited nor
what would be called enthusiastic about them&mdash;not
half so excited and enthusiastic as Andy
Hayes.</p>

<p>The dinner in the fine old room, under the
Vandykes, with Mrs. Belfield in her lavender silk
and precious lace, the girls in their white frocks,
the old silver, the wealth of flowers, seemed rather
wonderful to Andy Hayes. His life in boyhood
had been poor and meagre, in manhood hard and
rough. Here was a side of existence he had not
seen; as luxurious as the life of which he had
caught a glimpse at the great restaurant, but far
more serene, more dignified. His opening mind
<a class="pagenum" id="page_97" title="pg 97"></a>
received another new impression and a rarely
attractive one.</p>

<p>But the centre of the scene for him was Vivien
Wellgood. From his first sight of her in the
drawing-room he could not deny that. He had
never seen her in the evening before, and it was in
the evening that her frail beauty showed forth.
She was like a thing of gossamer that a touch
would spoil. She was so white in her low-cut
frock; all so white save for a little glow on the
cheeks that excitement and pleasure brought, save
for the brightness of her hair in the soft candle
light, save for the dark blue eyes which seemed to
keep watch and ward over her hidden thoughts.
Yes, she was&mdash;why, she was good enough for
Harry&mdash;good enough for Harry Belfield himself!
And he, Andy, Harry's faithful follower and worshipper,
would worship her too, if she would let
him (Harry, he knew, would), if she would not be
afraid of him, not dislike him or shrink from him.
That was all he asked, having in his mind not only
a bashful consciousness of his rude strength and
massive frame&mdash;they seemed almost threatening
beside her delicacy&mdash;but also a haunting recollection
that she could not endure such a number of things,
including butchers' shops.</p>

<p>No thought for himself, no thought of trying
to rival Harry, so much as crossed his mind. If
<a class="pagenum" id="page_98" title="pg 98"></a>
it had, it would have been banished as rank
treachery; but it could not, for the simple reason
that his attitude towards Harry made such an idea
utterly foreign to his thoughts. He was not
asking, as Isobel Vintry had asked that afternoon,
why he might not have his chance. It was not
the way of his nature to put forward claims for
himself&mdash;and, above all, claims that conflicted
with Harry's claims. The bare notion was to him
impossible.</p>

<p>He sat by her, but for some time she gave
herself wholly to listening to Harry, who had
found, on getting home, a letter from Billy Foot,
full of the latest political gossip from town. But
presently, the conversation drifting into depths of
politics where she could not follow, she turned to
Andy and said, "I'm getting on much better with
Curly. I pat him now!"</p>

<p>"That's right. It's only his fun."</p>

<p>"People's fun is sometimes the worst thing
about them."</p>

<p>"Well now, that's true," Andy acknowledged,
rather surprised to hear the remark from her.</p>

<p>"But I am getting on much better. And&mdash;well,
rather better at riding." She smiled at him in
confidence. "And nobody's said anything about
swimming. Do you know, when I feel myself
inclined to get frightened, I think about you!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_99" title="pg 99"></a>
"Do you find it helps?" asked Andy, much
amused and rather pleased.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's like thinking of a policeman in the
middle of the night."</p>

<p>"I suppose I do look rather like a policeman,"
said Andy reflectively.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do! That's it, I think." The
vague "it" seemed to signify the explanation of
the confidence Andy inspired.</p>

<p>"And how about dust and dirt, and getting very
hot?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Isobel says I'm a bit better about courage, but
not the least about fastidiousness."</p>

<p>"Fastidiousness suits some people, Miss Wellgood."</p>

<p>"It doesn't suit father, not in me," she murmured
with a woeful smile.</p>

<p>"Doesn't thinking about me help you there?
On the same principle it ought to."</p>

<p>"It doesn't," she murmured, with a trace of
confusion, and suddenly her eyes went blank.
Something was in her thoughts that she did not
want Andy to see. Was it the butcher's shop?
Andy's wits were not quick enough to ask the
question; but he saw that her confidential mood
had suffered a check.</p>

<p>Her confidence had been very pleasant, but
there were other things to listen to at the table.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_100" title="pg 100"></a>
Andy was heart-whole and intellectually voracious.</p>

<p>They, the rest of the company, had begun on
politics&mdash;imperial politics&mdash;and had discussed them
not without some friction. No Radical was
present&mdash;<i>Procul, O procul este, profani!</i>&mdash;but Wellgood
had the perversities of his anti-sentimental
attitude. A Tory at home, why was he to be a
democrat&mdash;or a Socialist&mdash;at the Antipodes?
Competition and self-interest were the golden rule
in England; was there to be another between
England and her colonies? The tie of blood&mdash;one
flag, one crown, one destiny&mdash;Wellgood
suspected his bugbear in every one of these cries.
Nothing for nothing&mdash;and for sixpence no more
than the coin was worth&mdash;with a preference for
five penn'orth if you could get out of it at that!
He stood steady on his firmly-rooted narrow foundation.</p>

<p>All of Harry was on fire against him. Was
blood nothing&mdash;race, colour, memories, associations,
the Flag, the Crown, and the Destiny? A
destiny to rule, or at least to manage, the planet!
Mother and Daughters&mdash;nothing in that?</p>

<p>Things were getting hot, and the ladies, who
always like to look on at the men fighting, much
interested. Mr. Belfield, himself no politician,
rather a student of human nature and addicted to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_101" title="pg 101"></a>
the Socratic attitude (so justly vexatious to practical
men who have to do something, good, bad, or
if not better, at least more plausible, than nothing)
interposed a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Mother and daughters? Hasn't husband and
wives become a more appropriate parallel?" He
smiled across the table at his own wife. "No
personal reference, my dear! But an attitude of
independence, without any particular desire to pay
the bills? Oh, I'm only asking questions!"</p>

<p>Andy was listening hard now. So was Vivien, for
she saw Harry's eyes alight and his mouth eager
to utter truths that should save the nation.</p>

<p>"If we could reach," said Harry, marvellously
handsome, somewhat rhetorical for a small party,
"if only we could once reach a true understanding
between ourselves and the self-governing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's going beyond my parallel, my
dear boy," his father interrupted. "If marriage
demanded mutual understanding, what man or
woman could risk it with eyes open?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?" Isobel Vintry was the questioner.</p>

<p>"Heavens, no, my dear Miss Vintry! Something
much less, something much less fundamentally
impossible. A good temper and a bad
memory, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Well done, pater!" cried Harry, readily
<a class="pagenum" id="page_102" title="pg 102"></a>
switched off from his heated enthusiasm. "Which
for the husband, which for the wife?"</p>

<p>"Both for both, Harry. Toleration to-day, and
an unlimited power of oblivion to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What nonsense you're talking, dear," placidly
smiled Mrs. Belfield.</p>

<p>"I'm exactly defining your own characteristics,"
he replied. "If you do that to a woman, she
always says you're talking nonsense."</p>

<p>"An unlimited supply of the water of Lethe,
pater? That does it?"</p>

<p>"That's about it, Harry. If you mix it with
a little sound Scotch whisky before you go to
bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andy burst into a good guffaw; the kindly
mocking humour pleased him. Vivien was alert
too; there was nothing to frighten, much to
enjoy; the glow deepened on her cheeks.</p>

<p>But Wellgood was not content; he was baulked
of his argument, of his fight.</p>

<p>"We've wandered from the point," he said
dourly. ("As if wanderings were not the best
things in the world!" thought more than one
of the party, more or less explicitly.) "We give,
they take." He was back to the United Kingdom
and the Colonies.</p>

<p>"Could anything be more nicely exact to my
parallel?" asked Belfield, socratically smiling.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_103" title="pg 103"></a>
"Did you ever know a marriage where each
partner didn't say, 'I give, you take'? Some
add that they're content with the arrangement,
others don't."</p>

<p>"Pater, you always mix up different things,"
Harry protested, laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm always trying to find out whether there
are any different things, Harry." He smiled at
his son. "Wives, that's what they are! And
several of them! Harry, we're in for all the
difficulties of polygamy! A preference to one&mdash;oh
no, I'm not spelling it with a big P! But&mdash;well,
the ladies ought to be able to help us here.
Could you share a heart, Miss Vintry?"</p>

<p>Isobel's white was relieved with gold trimmings;
she looked sumptuous. "I shouldn't like it," she
answered.</p>

<p>"What has all this got to do with the practical
problem?" Wellgood demanded. "Our trade
with the Colonies is no more than thirty per
cent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Mr. Wellgood. The gentlemen
had much better have kept to their politics,"
Mrs. Belfield interposed with suave placidity.
"They understand them. When they begin to
talk about women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Need of Lethe&mdash;whisky and Lethe-water!"
chuckled Harry. "In a large glass, eh, Andy?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_104" title="pg 104"></a>
Wellgood turned suddenly on Andy. "You've
lived in Canada. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Andy had been far too much occupied in listening.
Besides, he was no politician. He thought
deeply for a moment.</p>

<p>"A lot depends on whether you want to buy or
to sell." He delivered himself of this truth quite
solemnly.</p>

<p>"A very far-reaching observation," said Mr.
Belfield. "Goes to the root of human traffic, and,
quite possibly, to that of both the institutions which
we have been discussing. I wonder whether either
will be permanent!"</p>

<p>"Look here, pater, we're at dessert! Aren't
you starting rather big subjects?"</p>

<p>"Your father likes to amuse himself with curious
ideas," Mrs. Belfield remarked. "So did my
father; he once asked me what I thought would
happen if I didn't say my prayers. Men like
to ask questions like that, but I never pay much
attention to them. Shall we go into the drawing-room,
Vivien? It may be warm enough for a turn
in the garden, perhaps." She addressed the men.
"Bring your cigars and try."</p>

<p>The men were left alone. "The garden would
be jolly," said Harry.</p>

<p>Mr. Belfield coughed, and suddenly wheezed.
"Intimations of mortality!" he said apologetically.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_105" title="pg 105"></a>
"We've talked of a variety of subjects&mdash;to little
purpose, I suppose. But it's entertaining to survey
the field of humanity. Your views were briefly
expressed, Hayes."</p>

<p>"Everybody else was talking such a lot, sir,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>Belfield's humorous laugh was entangled in a
cough. "You'll never get that obstacle out of the
way of your oratory," he managed to stutter out.
"They always are! Talk rules the world&mdash;eh,
Wellgood?" He was maliciously provocative.</p>

<p>"We wait till they've finished talking. Then
we do what we want," said Wellgood. "Force
rules in the end&mdash;the readiness to kill and be
killed. That's the <i>ultima ratio</i>, the final argument."</p>

<p>"The women say that's out of date."</p>

<p>"The women!" exclaimed Wellgood contemptuously.</p>

<p>"They'll be in the garden," Harry opined.
"Shall we move, pater?"</p>

<p>"We might as well," said Belfield. "Are you
ready, Wellgood?"</p>

<p>Wellgood was ready&mdash;in spite of his contempt.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI.<a class="pagenum" id="page_106" title="pg 106"></a></h2>

<h2>THE WORLDS OF MERITON.</h2>


<p>The garden at Halton was a pleasant place on
a fine evening, with a moon waxing, yet not
obtrusively full, with billowing shrubberies, clear-cut
walks, lawns spreading in a gentle drabness that
would be bright green in to-morrow's sun&mdash;a place
pleasant in its calm, its spaciousness and isolation.
They all sat together in a ring for a while; smoke
curled up; a servant brought glasses that clinked
as they were set down with a cheery, yet not
urgent, suggestion.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right to go in for it," said
Wellgood to Harry. "It's your obvious line."
(He was referring to a public career.) "But,
after all, it's casting pearls before swine."</p>

<p>"Swine!" The note of exclamation was large.
"Our masters, Mr. Wellgood!"</p>

<p>"A decent allowance of bran, and a ring through
their noses&mdash;that's the thing for them!"</p>

<p>"Has anybody got a copy&mdash;well, another copy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_107" title="pg 107"></a>
of 'Coriolanus'?" Harry inquired in an affectation
of eagerness.</p>

<p>"Casting pearls before swine is bad business,
of course," said Belfield in his husky voice&mdash;he
was really unwise to be out of doors at all; "but
there are degrees of badness. If your pearls are
indifferent as pearls, and your swine admirable as
swine? And that's often the truth of it."</p>

<p>"My husband is sometimes perverse in his talk,
my dear," said Mrs. Belfield, aside to Vivien, to
whom she was being very kind. "You needn't
notice what he says."</p>

<p>"He's rather amusing," Vivien ventured, not
quite sure whether the adjective were respectful
enough.</p>

<p>"Andy, pronounce!" cried Harry Belfield; for
his friend sat in his usual meditative absorbing
silence.</p>

<p>"If I had to, I'd like to say a word from the
point of view of the&mdash;swine." Had the moon
been stronger, he might have been seen to blush.
"I don't want to be&mdash;oh, well, serious. That's
rot, I know&mdash;after dinner. But&mdash;well, you're all
in it&mdash;insiders&mdash;I'm an outsider. And I say that
what the swine want is&mdash;pearls!"</p>

<p>"If we've got them?" The question, or insinuation,
was Belfield's. He was looking at Andy with
a real, if an only half-serious, interest.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_108" title="pg 108"></a>
"Swine are swine," remarked Wellgood. "They
mustn't forget it. Neither must we."</p>

<p>"But pearls by no means always pearls?"
Belfield suggested. "Though they may look
the real thing if a pretty woman hangs them
round her neck."</p>

<p>Their talk went only for an embellishment of
their general state&mdash;so comfortable, so serene, so
exceptionally fortunate. Were not they pearls?
Andy had seen something of the swine, had perhaps
even been one of them. A vague protest stirred
in him; were they not too serene, too comfortable,
too fortunate? Yet he loved it all; it was beautiful.
How many uglies go to make one beautiful?
It is a bit of social arithmetic. When you have
got the result, the deduction may well seem difficult.</p>

<p>"It doesn't much matter whether they're real
or not, if a really pretty woman hangs them round
her neck," Harry laughed. "The neck carries the
pearls!"</p>

<p>"But we'd all rather they were real," said Isobel
Vintry suddenly, the first of the women to intervene.
"Other women guess, you see."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt so much if they do?" Belfield
asked.</p>

<p>"The only thing that really does hurt," Isobel
assured him, smiling.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_109" title="pg 109"></a>
"Oh, my dear, how disproportionate!" sighed
Mrs. Belfield.</p>

<p>"I'd never have anything false about me&mdash;pearls,
or lace, or hair, or&mdash;or anything about
me," exclaimed Vivien. "I should hate it!"
Feeling carried her into sudden unexpected speech.</p>

<p>Very gradually, very tentatively, Andy was finding
himself able to speak in this sort of company,
to speak as an equal to equals, not socially only,
but in an intellectual regard.</p>

<p>"Riches seem to me all wrong, but what they
produce, leaving out the wasters, all right." He
let it out, apprehensive of a censuring silence.
Belfield relieved him in a minute.</p>

<p>"I'm with you. I always admire most the
things to which I'm on principle opposed&mdash;a
melancholy state of one's mental interior! Kings,
lords, and bishops&mdash;crowns, coronets, and aprons&mdash;all
very attractive and picturesque!"</p>

<p>"We all know that the governor's a crypto-Radical,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"I thought Carlyle, among others, had taught
that we were all Radicals when in our pyjamas&mdash;or
less," said Belfield. "But that's not the point.
The excellence of things that are wrong, the
narrowness of the moral view!"</p>

<p>"My dear! Oh, well, my dear!" murmured
Mrs. Belfield.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_110" title="pg 110"></a>
"I've got a touch of asthma&mdash;I must say what I
like." Belfield humorously traded on his infirmity.
"A dishonest fellow who won't pay his tradesmen,
a flirtatious minx who will make mischief, a spoilt
urchin who insists on doing what he shouldn't&mdash;all
rather attractive, aren't they? If everybody
behaved properly we should have no 'situations.'
What would become of literature and the drama?"</p>

<p>"And if nobody had any spare cash, what would
become of them, either?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Well, we could do with a good deal less
of them. I'll go so far as to admit that," said
Wellgood.</p>

<p>Belfield laughed. "Even from Wellgood we've
extracted one plea for the redistribution of wealth.
A dialectical triumph! Let's leave it at that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Belfield carried her husband off indoors;
Wellgood went with them, challenging his host
to a game of bezique; Harry invited Vivien
to a stroll; Isobel Vintry and Andy were left
together. She asked him a sudden question:</p>

<p>"Do you think Harry Belfield a selfish man?"</p>

<p>"Selfish! Harry? Heavens, no! He'd do
anything for his friends."</p>

<p>"I don't mean quite in that way. I daresay he
would&mdash;and, of course, he's too well-mannered to
be selfish about trifles. But I suppose even to ask
questions about him is treason to you?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_111" title="pg 111"></a>
"Oh, well, a little bit," laughed Andy. "I'm
an old follower, you see!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he thinks it natural you should be,"
she suggested quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, if it is natural, why shouldn't he
think so?"</p>

<p>"It seems natural to him that he should always
come first, and&mdash;and have the pick of things."</p>

<p>"You mean he's spoilt? According to his
father, that makes him more attractive."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm not saying it doesn't do that. Only&mdash;do
you never mind it? Never mind playing
second fiddle?"</p>

<p>"Second fiddle seems rather a high position. I
hardly reckon myself in the orchestra at all," he
laughed. "You remember&mdash;I'm accustomed to
following the hunt on foot."</p>

<p>"While Harry Belfield rides! Yes! Vivien
rides too&mdash;and doesn't like it!"</p>

<p>She was bending forward in her chair, handsome,
sumptuous in her white and gold (Wellgood had
made her a present the quarter-day before), with
her smile very bitter. The smile told that she
spoke with a meaning more than literal. Andy
surveyed, at his leisure, possible metaphorical
bearings.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I think I see," he announced, after an
interval fully perceptible. "You mean she doesn't
<a class="pagenum" id="page_112" title="pg 112"></a>
really appreciate her advantages? By riding you
mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, really, Mr. Hayes!" She broke into vexed
amused laughter. "I mustn't try it any more
with you," she declared.</p>

<p>"But I shall understand if you give me time to
think it over," Andy protested. "Don't rush me,
that's all, Miss Vintry."</p>

<p>"As if I could rush any one or anything!" she
said, handsome still, now handsomely despairing.</p>

<p>To Andy she was a problem, needing time to
think over; to Wellgood she was a postulate,
assumed not proved, yet assumed to be proved;
to Harry she was&mdash;save for that subtle momentary
feeling on the terrace by the lake&mdash;Vivien's companion.
She wanted to be something other than
any of these. Follow the hounds on foot? She
would know what it was to ride! Know and not
like&mdash;in Vivien's fashion? Andy, slowly digesting,
saw her lips curve in that bitter smile again.</p>

<p>From a path near by, yet secluded behind a thick
trim hedge of yew, there sounded a girl's nervous
flutter of a laugh, a young man's exultant merriment.
Harry and Vivien, not far away, seemed
the space of a world apart&mdash;to Isobel; Andy was
normally conscious that they were not more than
twenty yards off, and almost within hearing if they
<a class="pagenum" id="page_113" title="pg 113"></a>
spoke. But he had been getting at Isobel's meaning&mdash;slowly
and surely.</p>

<p>"Being able to ride&mdash;having the opportunity&mdash;and
not caring&mdash;that's pearls before&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Mr. Hayes. I can imagine
you making a very good speech&mdash;after the election
is over!"</p>

<p>Andy laughed heartily, leaning back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"That's jolly good, Miss Vintry!" he said.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes after the poll closed you'd begin
to persuade the electors!" She spoke rather lower.
"Ten minutes after a girl had taken another man,
you'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give me time! I've never thought about
myself like that," cried Andy.</p>

<p>No more sounds from the path behind the yew
hedge. She was impatient with Andy&mdash;would
Harry never come back from that path?</p>

<p>He came back the next moment&mdash;he and Vivien.
Vivien's face was a confession, Harry's air a self-congratulation.</p>

<p>"I hope you've been making yourself amusing,
Andy?" asked Harry. His tone conveyed a
touch of amusement at the idea of Andy being
amusing.</p>

<p>"Miss Vintry's been pitching into me like
anything," said Andy, smiling broadly. "She says
<a class="pagenum" id="page_114" title="pg 114"></a>
I'm always a day after the fair. I'm going to think
it over&mdash;and try to get a move on."</p>

<p>His good-nature, his simplicity, his serious
intention to attempt self-improvement, tickled
Harry intensely. Why, probably Isobel had wanted
to flirt, and Andy had failed to play up to her!
He burst into a laugh; Vivien's laugh followed as
an applauding echo.</p>

<p>"A lecture, was it, Miss Vintry?" Harry asked
in banter.</p>

<p>"I could give you one too," said Isobel, colouring
a little.</p>

<p>"She gives me plenty!" Vivien remarked, with
a solemnly comic shake of her head.</p>

<p>"It's my business in life," said Isobel.</p>

<p>Just for a second Harry looked at her; an
impish smile was on his lips. Did she think that,
was she honest about it? Or was she provocative?
It crossed Harry's mind&mdash;past experiences facilitating
the transit of the idea&mdash;that she might be
saying to him, "Is that all a young woman of my
looks is good for? To give lectures?"</p>

<p>"You shall give me one at the earliest opportunity,
if you'll be so kind," he laughed, his eyes
boldly conveying that he would enjoy the lesson.
Vivien laughed again; it was great fun to see
Harry chaffing Isobel! She liked Isobel, but was
in awe of her. Had not Isobel all the difficult
<a class="pagenum" id="page_115" title="pg 115"></a>
virtues which it was her own woeful task to learn?
But Harry could chaff her&mdash;Harry could do anything.</p>

<p>"If I do, I'll teach you something you don't
know, Mr. Harry," Isobel said, letting her eyes
meet his with a boldness equal to his own. Again
that subtle feeling touched him, as it had on the
terrace by the lake.</p>

<p>"I'm ready to learn my lesson," he assured her,
with a challenging gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>She nodded rather scornfully, but accepting his
challenge. There was a last bit of by-play between
their eyes.</p>

<p>"It's really time to go, if Mr. Wellgood has
finished his game," said Isobel, rising.</p>

<p>The insinuation of the words, the by-play of
the eyes, had passed over Vivien's head and
outside the limits of Andy's perspicacity. To both
of them the bandying of words was but chaff; by
both the exchange of glances went unmarked.
Well, the whole thing was no more than chaff to
Harry himself; such chaff as he was very good at,
a practised hand&mdash;and not ignorant of why the
chaff was pleasant. And Isobel? Oh yes, she
knew! Harry was amused to find this knowledge
in Vivien's companion&mdash;this provocation, this
freemasonry of flirtation. Poor old Andy had, of
course, seen none of it! Well, perhaps it needed
a bit of experience&mdash;besides the temperament.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_116" title="pg 116"></a>
Indoors, farewell was soon said&mdash;hours ruled
early at Meriton. Soon said, yet not without some
significance in the saying. Mrs. Belfield was
openly affectionate to Vivien, and Belfield paternal
in a courtly way; Harry very devoted to the same
young lady, yet with a challenging "aside" of his
eyes for Isobel; Andy brimming over with a vain
effort to express adequately but without gush
his thanks for the evening. Belfield, being two
pounds the better of Wellgood over their bezique,
was in more than his usual good-temper&mdash;it was
spiced with malice, for the defeat of Wellgood (a
bad loser) counted for more than the forty shillings&mdash;and
gave Andy his hand and a pat on the back.</p>

<p>"It's not often one has to tell a man not to
undervalue himself," he remarked. "But I fancy
I might say that to you. Well, I'm no prophet;
but at any rate be sure you're always welcome at
this house for your own sake, as well as for
Harry's."</p>

<p>Getting into the carriage with Isobel and her
father, Vivien felt like going back to school. But
in all likelihood she would see Harry's eyes again
to-morrow. She did not forget to give a kindly
glance to solid Andy Hayes&mdash;not exciting, nor
bewildering, nor inflaming (as another was!), but
somehow comforting and reassuring to think of.
She sat down on the narrow seat, fronting her
<a class="pagenum" id="page_117" title="pg 117"></a>
father and Isobel. Yes&mdash;but school wouldn't
last much longer! And after school? Ineffable
heaven! Being with Harry, loving Harry, being
loved by&mdash;? That vaulting imagination seemed
still almost&mdash;nay, it seemed quite&mdash;impossible.
Yet if your own eyes assure you of things impossible&mdash;well,
there's a good case for believing
your eyes, and the belief is pleasant. Wellgood
sore over his two pounds, Isobel dissatisfied with
fate but challenging it, sat silent. The young girl's
lips curved in sweet memories and triumphant
anticipations. The best thing in the world&mdash;was
it actually to be hers? Almost she knew it, though
she would not own to the knowledge yet.</p>

<p>Happy was she in the handkerchief flung by her
hero! Happy was Harry Belfield in the ready
devotion, the innocent happy surrender, of one
girl, and the vexed challenge of another whom he
had&mdash;whom he had at least meant to ignore; he
could never answer for it that he would quite
ignore a woman who displayed such a challenge in
the lists of sex. But there was a happier being
still among those who left Halton that night. It
was Andy Hayes, before whom life had opened so,
who had enjoyed such a wonderful day-off, who
had been told not to undervalue himself, had
been reproached with being a day after the fair,
had undergone (as it seemed) an initiation into a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_118" title="pg 118"></a>
life of which he had hardly dreamt, yet of which
he appeared, in that one summer's day, to have
been accepted as a part.</p>

<p>Yes, Andy was on the whole the happiest&mdash;happier
even than Harry, to whom content, triumph,
and challenge were all too habitual; happier even
than Vivien, who had still some schooling to endure,
still some of love's finicking doubts, some of hope's
artificially prudent incredulity, to overcome;
beyond doubt happier than Wellgood, who had
lost two pounds, or Isobel Vintry, who had
challenged and had been told that her challenge
should be taken up&mdash;some day! Mrs. Belfield
was intent on sleeping well, as she always did; Mr.
Belfield on not coughing too much&mdash;as he generally
did. They were not competitors in happiness.</p>

<p>Andy walked home. Halton lay half a mile
outside the town; his lodgings were at the far end
of High Street. All through the long, broad,
familiar street&mdash;in old days he had known who lived
in well-nigh every house&mdash;his road lay. He
walked home under the stars. The day had been
wonderful; they who had figured in it peopled his
brain&mdash;delicate dainty Vivien first; with her,
brilliant Harry; that puzzling Miss Vintry; Mr.
Belfield, who talked so whimsically and had told
him not to undervalue himself; Wellgood, grim,
hard, merciless, yet somehow with the stamp of a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_119" title="pg 119"></a>
man about him; Mrs. Belfield serenely matching
with her house, her Vandykes, her garden, and the
situation to which it had pleased Heaven to call
her. Soberly now&mdash;soberly now&mdash;had he ever
expected to be a part of all this?</p>

<p>High Street lay dark and quiet. It was eleven
o'clock. He passed the old grammar school with
a thought of the dear old father&mdash;B.A. Oxon, which
had something to do with his wonderful day. He
passed the Lion, where "the Bird" officiated, and
Mr. Foulkes' office, where "Chinks" aspired to
become "gentleman, one etc"&mdash;so runs the formula
that gives a solicitor his status. All dark! Now
if by chance Jack Rock were up, and willing to
listen to a little honest triumphing! It had been
a day to talk about.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack was up; his parlour lights glowed
cosily behind red blinds. Yet Andy was not to
have a clear field for the recital of his adventures;
it was no moment for an exhibition of his honest
pride, based on an unimpaired humility. Jack
Rock had a party. The table was furnished with
beer, whisky, gin, tobacco, and clay pipes. Round
it sat old friends&mdash;Chinks and the Bird; the Bird's
father, Mr. Dove, landlord of the Lion; and Cox,
the veterinary surgeon. After the labours of the
week they were having a little "fling" on Saturday
night&mdash;convivially, yet in all reasonable temperance.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_120" title="pg 120"></a>
The elder men&mdash;Jack, Mr. Dove, and Cox&mdash;greeted
Andy with intimate and affectionate cordiality; a
certain constraint marked the manner of Chinks
and the Bird&mdash;they could not forget the afternoon's
encounter. His evening coat too, and his shirt-front!
Everybody marked them; but they had
a notion that he might have caught that habit in
London.</p>

<p>Andy's welcome over, Mr. Dove of the Lion
took up his tale at the point at which he had left
it. Mr. Dove had not Jack Rock's education&mdash;he
had never been at the grammar school but
he was a shrewd sensible old fellow, who prided
himself on the respectability of his "house" and
felt his responsibilities as a publican without
being too fond of the folk who were always
dinning them into his ears.</p>

<p>"I says to the girl, 'We don't want no carryings-on
at the Lion.' That's what I says, Jack.
She says, 'That wasn't nothing, Mr. Dove&mdash;only
a give and take o' nonsense. The bar between
us too! W'ere's the 'arm?' 'I don't like it, Miss
Miles,' I says, 'I don't like it, that's all.' 'Oh,
very good, Mr. Dove! You're master 'ere, o'
course; only, if you won't 'ave that, you won't
keep up your takings, that's all!' That's the way
she put it, Jack."</p>

<p>"Bit of truth in it, perhaps," Jack opined.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_121" title="pg 121"></a>
"There's a lot of truth in it," said the Bird
solemnly. "Fellers like to show off before a good-looking
girl&mdash;whether she's behind a bar or whether
she ain't."</p>

<p>"If there never 'adn't been barmaids, I wouldn't
be the one to begin it," said Mr. Dove. "I knows
its difficulties. But there they are&mdash;all them nice
girls bred to it! What are ye to do with 'em,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"A drink doesn't taste any worse for being
'anded&mdash;handed&mdash;to you by a pretty girl," said
Chinks with a knowing chuckle.</p>

<p>"Then you give 'er one&mdash;then you stand me
one&mdash;then you 'ave another yourself&mdash;just to say
'Blow the expense!' Oh, the girl knew the way
of it&mdash;I ain't saying she didn't!" Mr. Dove
smoked fast, evidently puzzled in his mind.
"And she's a good girl 'erself too, ain't she, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom blushed&mdash;blushed very visibly. Miss
Miles was not a subject of indifference to the
Bird.</p>

<p>"She's very civil-spoken," he mumbled shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"That she is&mdash;and a fine figure of a girl too,"
added Jack Rock. "Know her, Andy?"</p>

<p>Well, no! Andy did not know her; he felt
profoundly apologetic. Miss Miles was evidently
a person whom one ought to know, if one would
<a class="pagenum" id="page_122" title="pg 122"></a>
be in the world of Meriton. The world of
Meriton? It came home to him that there was
more than one.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox was a man who listened&mdash;in that
respect rather like Andy himself; but, when he
did speak, he was in the habit of giving a verdict,
therein deviating from Andy's humble way.</p>

<p>"Barmaids oughtn't to a' come into existence,"
he said. "Being there, they're best left&mdash;under
supervision." He nodded at old Dove, as though
to say, "You won't get any further than that if
you talk all night," and put his pipe back into
his mouth.</p>

<p>"The doctor's right, I daresay," said old Dove
in a tone of relief. It is always something of a
comfort to be told that one's problems are insoluble;
the obligation of trying to solve them is
thereby removed.</p>

<p>Jack accepted this ending to the discussion.</p>

<p>"And what have you been doing with yourself,
Andy?" he asked.</p>

<p>Andy found a curious difficulty in answering.
Tea and tennis at Nutley, dinner at Halton&mdash;it
seemed impossible to speak the words without
self-consciousness. He felt that Chinks and the
Bird had their eyes on him.</p>

<p>"Been at work all the week, Jack. Had a day-off
to-day."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_123" title="pg 123"></a>
Luckily Jack fastened on the first part of his
answer. He turned a keen glance on Andy.
"Business doin' well?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," Andy confessed. "It's a
bit hard for a new-comer to establish a connection."</p>

<p>"You're right there, Andy," commented old
Mr. Dove, serenely happy in the knowledge of an
ancient and good connection attaching to the
Lion.</p>

<p>"Oh, not particularly well?" Jack nodded with
an air of what looked like satisfaction, though it
would not be kind to Andy to be satisfied.</p>

<p>"Playing lawn-tennis at Nutley, weren't you?"
asked Chinks suddenly.</p>

<p>All faces turned to Andy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was, Chinks," he said.</p>

<p>"Half expected you to supper, Andy," said
Jack Rock.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Jack. I would have come if I'd been
free. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, where were you?"</p>

<p>There was no help for it.</p>

<p>"I was dining out, Jack."</p>

<p>Andy's tone became as airy as he could make
it, as careless, as natural. His effort in this kind
was not a great success.</p>

<p>"Harry Belfield asked me to Halton."</p>

<p>A short silence followed. They were good
<a class="pagenum" id="page_124" title="pg 124"></a>
fellows, one and all of them; nobody had a jibe
for him; the envy, if envy there were, was even
as his own for Harry Belfield. Cox looked round
and raised his glass.</p>

<p>"'Ere's to you, Andy! You went to the war,
you went to foreign parts. If you've learned a
bit and got on a bit, nobody in Meriton's goin'
to grudge it you&mdash;least of all them as knew your
good father, who was a gentleman if ever there
was one&mdash;and I've known some of the best, consequent
on my business layin' mainly with 'orses."</p>

<p>"Dined at Halton, did you?" Old Jack Rock
beamed, then suddenly grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I've always known Harry
Belfield, and&mdash;" He was apologizing.</p>

<p>"The old gentleman used to dine there&mdash;once
a year reg'lar," Jack reminded him. "Quite right
of 'em to keep it up with you." But still Jack
looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>Eleven-thirty sounded from the squat tower of
the long low church which presided over the west
end&mdash;the Fyfold end&mdash;of High Street. Old Cox
knocked out his pipe decisively. "Bedtime!"
he pronounced.</p>

<p>Nobody contested the verdict. Only across
Andy's mind flitted an outlandish memory that
it was the hour at which one sat down to supper
at the great restaurant&mdash;with Harry, the Nun,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_125" title="pg 125"></a>
sardonic Miss Dutton, Billy Foot, and London
at large&mdash;and at liberty.</p>

<p>"You stop a bit, my lad," said Jack with affection,
also with a touch of old-time authority. "I've
something to say to you, Andy."</p>

<p>Andy stayed willingly enough; he liked Jack,
and he was loth to end that day.</p>

<p>Jack filled and pressed, lit, pressed, and lit again,
a fresh clay pipe.</p>

<p>"You like all that sort of thing, Andy?" he
asked. "Oh, you know what I mean&mdash;what you've
been doin' to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes, I like it, Jack." Andy saw that his dear
old friend&mdash;dear Nancy's brother&mdash;had something
of moment on his mind.</p>

<p>"But it don't count in the end. It's not business,
Andy." Jack's tone had become, suddenly
and strangely, persuasive, reasonably persuasive&mdash;almost
what one might call coaxing.</p>

<p>"I've never considered it in the light of business,
Jack."</p>

<p>"Don't let it turn you from business, Andy.
You said the timber was worth about two hundred
a year to you?"</p>

<p>"About that; it'll be more&mdash;or less&mdash;before
I'm six months older. It's sink or swim, you
know."</p>

<p>"You've no call to sink," said Jack Rock with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_126" title="pg 126"></a>
emphasis. "Your father's son ain't goin' to sink
while Jack Rock can throw a lifebelt to him."</p>

<p>"I know, Jack. I'd ask you for half your
last crust, and you'd soak it in milk for me as
you used to&mdash;if you had to steal the milk! But&mdash;well,
what's up?"</p>

<p>"I'm gettin' on in life, boy. I've enough to
do with the horses. I do uncommon well with
the horses. I've a mind to give myself to
that. Not but what I like the meat. Still I've
a mind to give myself to the horses. The meat's
worth&mdash;Oh, I'll surprise you, Andy, and don't let
it go outside o' this room&mdash;the meat's worth nigh
on five hundred a year! Aye, nigh on that!
The chilled meat don't touch me much, nor the
London stores neither. Year in, year out, nigh
on five hundred! Nancy loved you; the old
gentleman never said a word as showed he knew
a difference between me and him. Though he
must have known it. I'm all alone, Andy. While
I can I'll keep the horses&mdash;Lord, I love the
horses! You drop your timber. Take over the
meat, Andy. You're a learnin' chap; you'll soon
pick it up from me and Simpson. Take over the
meat, Andy. It's a safe five hundred a year!"</p>

<p>So he pleaded to have his great benefaction
accepted. He had meant to give in a manner
perhaps somewhat magnificent; what he gave was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_127" title="pg 127"></a>
to him great. The news of tea and tennis at
Nutley, of dinner at Halton, induced a new note.
Proud still, yet he pleaded. It was a fine business&mdash;the
meat! Nor chilled meat, nor stores mattered
seriously; his connection was so high-class. Five
hundred a year! It was luxury, position, importance;
it was all these in Meriton. His eyes
waited anxiously for Andy's answer.</p>

<p>Andy caught his hand across the table. "Dear
old Jack, how splendid of you!"</p>

<p>"Well, lad?"</p>

<p>For the life of him Andy could say nothing
more adequate, nothing less disappointing, less
ungrateful, than "I'd like to think it over. And
thanks, Jack!"</p>

<h2>Chapter VII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_128" title="pg 128"></a></h2>

<h2>ENTERING FOR THE RACE.</h2>

<p>Andy Hayes had never supposed that he
would be the victim of a problem, or exposed
to the necessity of a momentous choice.
Life had hitherto been very simple to him&mdash;doing
his work, taking his pay, spending the money
frugally and to the best advantage, sparing a small
percentage for the Savings Bank, and reconciling
with this programme the keen enjoyment of such
leisure hours as fell to his lot. A reasonable,
wholesome, manageable scheme of life! Or, rather,
not a scheme at all&mdash;Andy was no schemer. That
was the way life came&mdash;the way an average man
saw it and accepted it. From first to last he
never lost the conception of himself as an average
man, having his capabilities, yet strictly conditioned
by the limits of the practicable; free in his soul,
by no means perfectly free in his activities. Andy
never thought in terms of "environment" or
such big words, but he always had a strong sense
<a class="pagenum" id="page_129" title="pg 129"></a>
of what a fellow like himself could expect; the
two phrases may, perhaps, come to much the same
thing.</p>

<p>In South Africa he had achieved his sergeant's
stripes&mdash;not a commission, nor the Victoria Cross,
nor anything brilliant. In Canada he had not
become a millionaire, nor even a prosperous man
or a dashing speculator; he had been thought a
capable young fellow, who would, perhaps, be
equal to developing the English side of the business.
Andy might be justified in holding himself
no fool: he had no ground for higher claims, no
warrant for anything like ambition.</p>

<p>Thus unaccustomed to problems, he had expected
to toss uneasily (he had read of many
heroes who "tossed uneasily") on his bed all
night through. Lawn-tennis and a good dinner
saved him from that romantic but uncomfortable
ordeal; he slept profoundly till eight-thirty. Just
before he was called&mdash;probably between his landlady's
knock and her remark that it was eight-fifteen
(she was late herself)&mdash;he had a brief vivid
dream of selling a very red joint of beef to a very
pallid Vivien Wellgood&mdash;a fantastic freak of the
imagination which could have nothing to do with
the grave matter in hand.</p>

<p>Yet, on the top of this, as he lay abed awhile
in the leisure of Sunday morning, with no train
<a class="pagenum" id="page_130" title="pg 130"></a>
to catch, he remembered his father's B.A. Oxon;
he recalled his mother's unvarying designation
of old Jack as "the butcher;" he recollected
Nancy's pride in marrying "out of her class"&mdash;it
had been her own phrase, sometimes in boast,
sometimes in apology. Though Nancy had a
dowry of a hundred pounds a year&mdash;charged on
the business, and now returned to Jack Rock since
Nancy left no children&mdash;she never forgot that she
had married out of her class. And into his
father's? And into his own? "I'm a snob!"
groaned Andy.</p>

<p>He grew a little drowsy again, and in his
drowsiness again played tennis at Nutley, again
dined at Halton, again saw Vivien in the butcher's
shop, and again was told by Mr. Belfield not to
undervalue himself. But is to take nigh on five
hundred pounds a year to undervalue yourself&mdash;you
who are making a precarious two? And where lies
the difference between selling wood and selling meat&mdash;wood
from Canada and meat in Meriton? Andy's
broad conception of the world told him that there
was none; his narrow observation of the same
sphere convinced him that the difference was, in
its practical bearings, considerable. Nay, confine
yourself to meat alone: was there no difference
between importing cargoes of that questionable
"chilled" article and disposing of joints of unquestionable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_131" title="pg 131"></a>
"home-bred" over the counter? All
the argument was for the home-bred. But to
sell the home-bred joints one wore a blue apron
and carried a knife and a steel&mdash;or, at all events,
smacked of doing these things; whereas the
wholesale cargoes of "chilled" involved no such
implements or associations. Once again, Canada
was Canada, New Zealand New Zealand, Meriton
Meriton. With these considerations mingled two
pictures&mdash;dinner at Halton, and Jack Rock's convivial
party.</p>

<p>"I'll get up," said Andy, too sore beset by his
problem to lie abed any more.</p>

<p>Church! The bells rang almost as soon as
Andy&mdash;he had dawdled and lounged over dressing
and breakfast in Sunday's beneficent leisure&mdash;was
equipped for the day. In Meriton everybody went
to Church, except an insignificant, tolerated, almost
derided minority who frequented a very small,
very ugly Methodist chapel in a by-street&mdash;for
towns like Meriton are among the best preserves
of the Establishment. Andy always went to church
on a Sunday morning, answering the roll-call,
attending parade, accepting the fruits of his fathers'
wisdom, as his custom was. "Church, and a slice
of that cold beef, and then a jolly long walk!"
he said to himself. He had a notion that this
typical English Sunday&mdash;the relative value of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_132" title="pg 132"></a>
whose constituents he did not, and we need not,
exactly assess&mdash;might help him to settle his problem.
The cold beef and the long walk made part of the
day's character&mdash;the "Church" completed it.
This was Andy's feeling; it is not, of course, put
forward as what he ought to have felt.</p>

<p>So Andy went to church&mdash;in a cut-away coat
and a tall hat, though it drizzled, and he would
sooner have been in a felt hat, impervious to the
rain. He sat just half-way down the nave, and
it must be confessed that his attention wandered.
He had such a very important thing to settle in
this world; it would not go out of his mind,
though he strove to address himself to the issues
which the service suggested. He laboured under
the disadvantage of not being conscious of flagrant
iniquity, though he duly confessed himself a
miserable offender. He looked round on the
neighbours he knew so well; they were all confessing
that they were miserable offenders. Andy
believed it&mdash;it was in the book&mdash;but he considered
most of them to be good and honest people, and
he was almost glad to see that they did not look
hopelessly distressed over their situation.</p>

<p>The First Lesson caught and chained his
wandering attention. It was about David and
Jonathan; it contained the beautiful lament of
friend for friend, the dirge of a brotherly love.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_133" title="pg 133"></a>
The Rector's voice was rather sing-song, but it
would have needed a worse delivery to spoil the
words: "How are the mighty fallen in the midst
of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in
thine high places! I am distressed for thee, my
brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been
unto me; thy love for me was wonderful, passing
the love of women. How are the mighty fallen
and the weapons of war perished!" Thus ended
the song, so rich in splendour, so charged with
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Clinking!" was Andy's inward comment.
Then in a flash came the thought, "Why, of
course, I must ask Harry Belfield; he'll tell me
what to do all right."</p>

<p>The reference of his problem to Harry ought
to have disposed of it for good, and left Andy
free to perform his devotions with a single mind.
But it only set him wondering what Harry would
decide, wondering hard and&mdash;there was no escaping
from it&mdash;jealously. His service in the ranks,
his residence in communities at least professedly
democratic, had not made him a thorough democrat,
it seemed. He might have acquired the side
of democracy the easier of the two to acquire;
he might be ready to call any man his equal, whatever
his station or his work. He stumbled at the
harder task of seeing himself, whatever his work
<a class="pagenum" id="page_134" title="pg 134"></a>
or station, as any man's equal&mdash;at claiming or
assuming, not at according, equality. And in
Meriton! To claim or assume equality with any
and every man in Meriton would, if he accepted
Jack Rock's offer, be to court ridicule from equals
and unequals all alike, and most of all from his
admitted inferiors. Surely Harry would never
send him to the butcher's shop? That would
mean that Harry thought of him (for all his kindness)
as of Chinks or of the Bird. Could he risk
discovering that, after all, Harry&mdash;and Harry's
friends&mdash;thought of him like that? A sore pang
struck him. Had he been at Nutley&mdash;at Halton&mdash;only
on sufferance? He had an idea that Harry
would send him to the butcher's shop&mdash;would do
the thing ever so kindly, ever so considerately,
but all the same would do it. "Well, it's the
safe thing, isn't it, old chap?" he fancied Harry
saying; and then returning to his own high
ambitions, and being thereafter very friendly&mdash;whenever
he chanced to pass the shop. Andy
never deceived himself as to the quality of Harry's
friendship: it lay, at the most, in appreciative
acceptance of unbounded affection. It was not
like Jonathan's for David. Andy was content.
And must not acceptance, after all, breed some
return? For whatever return came he was
grateful. In this sphere there was no room
<a class="pagenum" id="page_135" title="pg 135"></a>
even for theories of equality, let alone for its
practice.</p>

<p>For some little time back Andy had been surprised
to observe a certain attribute of his own&mdash;that
of pretty often turning out right. He accounted
for it by saying that an average man,
judging of average men and things, would fairly
often be right&mdash;on an average; men would do
what he expected, things would go as he expected&mdash;on
an average. Such discernment as was implied
in this Andy felt as no endowment, no
clairvoyance; rather it was that his limitations
qualified him to appreciate other people's. He
would have liked to feel able to except Harry
Belfield who should have no limitations&mdash;only
he felt terribly sure of what Harry Belfield would
say: Safety, and the shop!</p>

<p>By this time the church service was ended, the
cold beef eaten, most of the long walk achieved.
For while these things went straight on to an end,
Andy's thoughts rolled round and round, like a
squirrel in a cage.</p>

<p>"A man's only got one life," Andy was thinking
to himself for the hundredth time as, having
done his fifteen miles, he came opposite the entry
to Nutley on his way home after his walk. What
a lot of thoughts and memories there had been
on that walk! Walking alone, a man is the victim&mdash;or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_136" title="pg 136"></a>
the beneficiary&mdash;of any number of stray
recollections, ideas, or fancies. He had even
thought of&mdash;and smiled over&mdash;sardonic Miss
Dutton's sardonic remark that he was worth ten
of either Billy Foot or&mdash;Harry Belfield! Well,
the poor girl had come one cropper; allowances
must be made.</p>

<p>Cool, serene, with what might appear to the
eyes of less happy people an almost insolently
secure possession of fortune's favour, Harry Belfield
stood at Nutley gate. Andy, hot and dusty,
winced at being seen by him; Harry was so
remote from any disarray. Andy's heart leapt at
the sight of his friend&mdash;and seemed to stand still
in the presence of his judge. Because the thing&mdash;the
problem&mdash;must come out directly. There was
no more possibility of shirking it.</p>

<p>Vivien was flitting&mdash;her touch of the ground
seemed so light&mdash;down the drive, past the deep
dark water, to join Harry for a stroll. His invitation
to a stroll on that fine still Sunday afternoon
had not been given without significance nor received
without a thousand tremblings. So it would
appear that it was Andy's ill-fortune to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harry was smoking. He took his cigar out
of his mouth to greet Andy.</p>

<p>"Treadmill again, old boy? Getting the fat
off?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_137" title="pg 137"></a>
"You're the one man I wanted to see." Then
Andy's face fell; it was an awful moment. "I
want to ask your advice."</p>

<p>"Look sharp!" said Harry, smiling. "I've
an appointment. She'll be here any minute."</p>

<p>"Jack Rock's offered to turn the shop over to
me, as soon as I learn the business. I say, I&mdash;I
suppose I ought to accept? He says it's worth
hard on five hundred a year. I say, keep that
dark; he told me not to tell anybody."</p>

<p>"Gad, is it?" said Harry, and whistled softly.</p>

<p>Vivien came in sight of him, and walked more
slowly, dallying with anticipation.</p>

<p>"Splendid of him, isn't it? I say, I suppose
I ought to&mdash;to think it over?" He had been
doing nothing else for what seemed eternity.</p>

<p>Harry laughed&mdash;that merry irresponsible laugh
of his. "Blue suits your complexion, Andy. It
seems damned funny&mdash;but five hundred a year!
Worth that, is it now, really? And he'd probably
leave you anything else he has."</p>

<p>Silently-flitting Vivien was just behind Harry
now. Andy saw her, Harry was unaware of her
presence. She laid her finger on her lips, making
a confidant of Andy, in her joy at a trick on her
lover.</p>

<p>"Of course it&mdash;well, it sort of defines matters&mdash;ties
you down, eh?" Harry's laugh broke out
<a class="pagenum" id="page_138" title="pg 138"></a>
again. "Andy, old boy, you'll look infernally
funny, pricing joints to old Dove or Miss
Pink! Oh, I say, I don't think you can do it,
Andy!"</p>

<p>"Don't you, Harry?" Andy's tone was eager,
beseeching, full of hope.</p>

<p>"But I suppose you ought." Harry tried to
be grave, and chuckled again. "You'd look it
uncommon well, you know. You'd soon develop
the figure. Old Jack never has&mdash;doesn't look as
if his own steaks did him any good. But you&mdash;we'd
send you to Smithfield in no time!"</p>

<p>"What are you two talking about?" asked
Vivien suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are at last! Why, the funniest
thing! Old Andy here wants to be a butcher."</p>

<p>"I don't want&mdash;" Andy began.</p>

<p>"A butcher! What nonsense you do talk
sometimes, Harry!" She stood by Harry's side,
so happy in him, so friendly to Andy.</p>

<p>"Fact!" said Harry, and acquainted her with
the situation.</p>

<p>Vivien blushed red. "I&mdash;I'm very sorry I said
what&mdash;what I did to you. You remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I remember," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Of course I&mdash;I never knew&mdash;I never thought&mdash;Of
course, somebody must&mdash;Oh, do forgive me,
Mr. Hayes!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_139" title="pg 139"></a>
Harry raised his brows in humorous astonishment.
"All this is a secret to me."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I told Mr. Hayes I didn't like&mdash;well&mdash;places
where they sold meat&mdash;raw meat, Harry."</p>

<p>"What do you think really, Harry?" Andy
asked.</p>

<p>Harry shrugged his shoulders. "Your choice,
old man," he said. "You've looked at all sides
of it, of course. It's getting latish, Vivien."</p>

<p>Andy would almost rather have had the verdict
which he feared. "Your choice, old man"&mdash;and
a shrug of the shoulders. Yet his loyalty intervened
to tell him that Harry was right. It was
his choice, and must be. He found Vivien's eyes
on him&mdash;those distant, considering eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose you couldn't give me an opinion,
Miss Wellgood?" he asked, mustering a smile
with some difficulty.</p>

<p>Vivien's lips drooped; her eyes grew rather sad
and distinctly remote. She gave no judgment;
she merely uttered a regret&mdash;a regret in which
social and personal prejudice (it could not be acquitted
of that) struggled with kindliness for
Andy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you were going to be a friend
of ours," she murmured sadly. She gave Andy
a mournful little nod of farewell&mdash;of final farewell,
as it seemed to his agitated mind&mdash;and walked off
<a class="pagenum" id="page_140" title="pg 140"></a>
with Harry, who was still looking decidedly
amused.</p>

<p>That our great crises can have an amusing side
even in the eyes of those who wish us well is one
of life's painful discoveries. Andy had expected
to be told that he must accept Jack Rock's offer,
but he had not thought that Harry would chaff
him about it. He tried, in justice to Harry and
in anxiety not to feel sore with his hero, to see
the humorous side for himself. He admitted that
he could not. A butcher was no more ridiculous
than any other tradesman. Well, the comic papers
were rather fond of putting in butchers, for some
inscrutable reason. Perhaps Harry happened to
think of some funny picture. Could that idea
give Andy a rag of comfort to wrap about his
wound? The comfort was of indifferent quality;
the dressing made the wound smart.</p>

<p>He was alone in the road again, gay Harry and
dainty Vivien gone, thinking little of him by now,
no doubt. Yes, the choice must be his own. On
one side lay safety for him and joy for old Jack;
on the other a sore blow to Jack, and for himself
the risk of looking a sad fool if he came to grief
in London. So far the choice appeared easy.</p>

<p>But that statement of the case left out everything
that really tugged at Andy's heart. For the
first time in his existence he was, vaguely and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_141" title="pg 141"></a>
dimly, trying to conceive and to consider his life
as a whole, and asking what he meant to do with
it. Acutest self-reproach assailed him; he accused
himself inwardly of many faults and follies&mdash;of
ingratitude, of snobbishness, of a ridiculous self-conceit.
Wasn't it enough for a chap like him
to earn a good living honestly? Oughtn't he to
be thankful for the chance? What did he expect
anyhow? He was very scornful with himself,
fiercely reproving all the new stirrings in him, yet
at the same time trying to see what they came to;
trying to make out what they, in their turn, asked,
what they meant, what would content them. He
could not satisfy himself what the stirrings meant
nor whence they came. When he asked what
would content them he could get only a negative
answer; keeping the shop in Meriton would not.
In regard neither to what it entailed nor to what
it abandoned could the stirrings find contentment
in that.</p>

<p>He had been walking along slowly and moodily.
Suddenly he quickened his pace; his steps became
purposeful. He was going to Jack Rock's. Jack
would be just having his tea, or smoking the pipe
that always followed it.</p>

<p>Jack sat in his armchair. Tea was finished, and
his pipe already alight. When he saw Andy's
face he chuckled.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_142" title="pg 142"></a>
"Ah, that's how I like to see you look, lad!"
he exclaimed joyfully. "Not as you did when
you went away last night."</p>

<p>"Why, how do I look?" asked Andy, amazed
at this greeting.</p>

<p>"As if you'd just picked up a thousand pound;
and so you have, and better than that."</p>

<p>All unknown to himself, Andy's face had answered
to his feelings&mdash;to the sense of escape
from bondage, of liberty restored, of possibilities
once more within his reach. The renewed lightness
of his heart had made his face happy
and triumphant. But it fell with a vengeance
now.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Jack, to whom the change of
expression was bewildering.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;I've never been so sorry in my
life&mdash;but I&mdash;I can't do it, Jack."</p>

<p>Jack sat smoking silently for a while. "That
was what you were lookin' so happy about, was
it?" he asked at last, with a wry smile. "I've
never afore seen a man so happy over chuckin'
away five hundred a year. Where does the fun
come in, Andy?"</p>

<p>"O lord, Jack, I can't&mdash;I can't tell you about
it. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if it does do you all that good, I suppose
you've got to do it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_143" title="pg 143"></a>
Andy came up to him, holding out his hand.
Jack took it and gave it a squeeze.</p>

<p>"I reckon I know more about it than you think.
I've been goin' over things since last night&mdash;and
goin' back to old things too&mdash;about the old gentleman
and Nancy."</p>

<p>"It seems so awfully&mdash;Lord, it seems everything
that's bad and rotten, Jack."</p>

<p>"No, it don't," said old Jack quietly. "It's
a bit of a facer for me&mdash;I tell you that straight&mdash;but
it don't seem unnatural in you. Only I'm
sorry like."</p>

<p>"If there was anything in the world I could do,
Jack! But there it is&mdash;there isn't."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that." He was smoking
very slowly, and seemed to be thinking hard.
Andy lit a cigarette. His joy was quenched in
sympathy with Jack.</p>

<p>"You've given me a disappointment, Andy.
I'm not denyin' it. But there, I can't expect
you to feel about the business as I do. Comin'
to me from my father, and havin' been the work
o' the best years of my life! And no better
business in any town of the size o' Meriton all
the country through&mdash;I'll wager that! No, you
can't feel as I do. And you've a right to choose
your own life. There's one thing you might do
for me, Andy, though."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_144" title="pg 144"></a>
"Well, if there's anything else in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I loved Nancy better than anybody, and the
old gentleman&mdash;well, as I've told you, he never
let me see a difference. I've got no kin&mdash;unless
I can call you kin, Andy. If you want to make
up for givin' me this bit of&mdash;of a facer, as I say,
I'll tell you what you can do. There's times in
a young chap's life when bein' able to put up
a bit o' the ready makes all the difference, eh?
If so be as you should find yourself placed like that,
I want you to promise to ask me for it. Will you,
lad?" Jack's voice faltered for a moment. "No
call for you to go back across half the world for
it. It's here, waitin' for you in Martin's bank in
High Street. If you ever want to enter for an
event, let me put up the stakes for you, Andy.
Promise me that, and we'll say no more about
the shop."</p>

<p>Andy was touched to the heart. "I promise.
There's my hand on it, Jack."</p>

<p>"You'll come to me first&mdash;you won't go to any
one before me?" old Jack insisted jealously.</p>

<p>"I'll come to you first&mdash;and last," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad." The old fellow's eyes gleamed
again. "Then it'll be our race. We'll both be in
it, won't we, Andy? And if you pass the post first,
I shall have a right to throw up my hat. And why
shouldn't you? The favourite don't always win."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_145" title="pg 145"></a>
"I'm not expecting to do anything remarkable,
Jack. I'm not such a fool as that."</p>

<p>"You're no fool, or you'd never have been put
to the trouble of refusin' my shop," observed Jack
with emphasis. "And in the end I'm not sure
but what you're right. I've never tried to rise
above where I was born; but I don't know as
there's any call for you to step down. I don't
know as I did my duty by the old gentleman in
temptin' you. I'm not sure he'd have liked it,
though he'd have said nothing; he'd never have
let me see&mdash;not him!" He sighed and smiled
over his reverential memories of the old gentleman,
yet his eyes twinkled rather maliciously as he said
to Andy, "Dinin' at Halton again to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Andy, "I'm not. I'm coming
to supper with you if you'll have me. What
have you got?"</p>

<p>"Cold boiled aitch-bone, and apple-pie, and a
Cheshire in good condition."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's prime! But I must go and change
first. I've walked fifteen or sixteen miles, and
I must get into a clean shirt."</p>

<p>"We don't dress for supper&mdash;not o' Sundays,"
Jack informed him gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, get out, Jack!" called Andy from the
door.</p>

<p>"Supper at nine precise, carriages at eleven,"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_146" title="pg 146"></a>
Jack called after him, pursuing his joke to the
end with keen relish.</p>

<p>Andy walked back to his lodgings, in the old
phrase "happy as a king," and infinitely the happier
because old Jack had taken it so well, had understood,
and, though disappointed, had not been hurt
or wounded. There was no breach in their affection
or in their mutual confidence. And now, he felt,
he had to justify himself in Jack's eyes, to justify
his refusal of a safe five hundred pounds a year.
The refusal became, as he thought over it, a spur
to effort, to action. "I must put my back into
it," said Andy to himself, and made up his mind
to most strenuous exertions to develop that rather
shy and coy timber business of his in London.</p>

<p>Yet, after he had changed, as he sat listening to
the church bells ringing for evening service, a softer
strain of meditation mingled with these stern resolves.
Memories of his "Saturday-off" glided
across his mind, echoes of this evening's encounter
with Harry and Vivien sounded in his ears. There
was, as old Jack Rock himself had ended by
suggesting, no call for him to step down. He
could take the place for which he was naturally
fit. He need not renounce that side of life of
which he had been allowed a glimpse so attractive
and so full of interest. The shop in Meriton
would have opened the door to one very comfortable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_147" title="pg 147"></a>
little apartment. How many doors would it
not have shut? All doors were open now.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to be a friend of
ours." Andy, sitting in the twilight, listening
to the bells, smiled at the echo of those regretful
words. He cherished their kindliness, and smiled
at their prejudice. The shop and Vivien were
always connected in his mind since the first day
he had met her. Her words came back to him
now, summing up all that he would have lost by
acceptance, hinting pregnantly at all that his refusal
might save or bring.</p>

<p>He stretched his arms and yawned; mind and
body both enjoyed a happy relaxation after effort.</p>

<p>"What a week-end it's been!" he thought.
Indeed it had&mdash;a week-end that was the beginning
of many things.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_148" title="pg 148"></a></h2>

<h2>WONDERFUL WORDS.</h2>

<p>Fully aware of his son's disposition and partly
acquainted with his experiences, Mr. Belfield
had urged Harry to "go slow" in his courting
of Vivien Wellgood. An opinion that marriage
was Harry's best chance was not inconsistent with
advising that any particular marriage should be
approached with caution and due consideration,
that a solid basis of affection should be raised,
calculated to stand even though the winds of time
carried away the lighter and more fairy-like
erections of Harry's romantic fancy. To do
Harry justice, he did his best to obey the paternal
counsel; but ideas of speed in such matters, and
of cautious consideration, differ. What to Harry
was sage delay would have seemed to many others
lighthearted impetuosity. He waited a full fortnight
after he was absolutely sure of&mdash;well, of the
wonderful thing he was so sure of&mdash;a fortnight
after he was absolutely sure that Vivien was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_149" title="pg 149"></a>
absolutely sure also. (The fortnights ran concurrently.)
Then he began to feel rather foolish.
What on earth was he waiting for? A man could
not be more than absolutely sure. Yet perhaps,
in pure deference to his father, he would have
waited a week longer, and so achieved, or sunk
to, an almost cold-blooded deliberation. (He had
known Mrs. Freere only a week before he declared&mdash;and
abjured&mdash;a passion!) He was probably
right; it was no good waiting. No greater
security could be achieved by that. Whether
the pursuit were deliberate or impetuous, an end
must come to it. It was afterwards&mdash;when the
chase was over and the quarry won&mdash;that the
danger came for Harry and men like him. Sage
delay and a solid basis of affection could not
obviate that peril; the born hunter would still
listen to the horn that sounded a new chase.
Somewhere in the world&mdash;so the theory ran&mdash;there
must live the woman who could deafen
Harry's ears to a fresh blast of the horn. On
that theory monogamy depends for its personal&mdash;as
distinguished from its social&mdash;justification.
So Mr. Belfield reasoned, with a smile, and
counselled delay. But there were no means of
ransacking the world, and even the theory itself
was doubtful. Harry was an eager advocate of
the theory, but thought that there was no need
<a class="pagenum" id="page_150" title="pg 150"></a>
to search beyond little Meriton for the woman.
At any rate, if Meriton did not hold her, she did
not exist&mdash;the theory stood condemned. Still
he would wait one week more&mdash;to please his
father.</p>

<p>A thing happened, a word was spoken, the like
of which he had never anticipated. To defend
himself laughingly against comparisons with the
proverbial Lothario, to protest with burlesque earnestness
against charges of susceptibility, fickleness,
and extreme boldness of assault&mdash;Harry played
that part well, and was well-accustomed to play
it. But to suffer a challenge, to endure a taunt,
to be subjected to a sneer, as a slow-coach, a faint-heart,
a boy afraid to tell a girl he loved her,
afraid to snatch what he desired! This was a
new experience for Harry Belfield, new and unbearable.
And when he had only been trying
to please his father! Hang this pleasing of one's
father, if it leads to things like that!</p>

<p>He dashed up to Nutley one fine afternoon on
his bicycle; he was teaching Vivien the exercise,
and she was finding that even peril had its charms.
But he was late for his appointment. Isobel
Vintry sat alone on the terrace by the water.</p>

<p>"How are you, Miss Vintry? I say, I'm afraid
I'm late. Where's Vivien?"</p>

<p>"You're nearly half an hour late."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_151" title="pg 151"></a>
"Well, I know. I couldn't help it. Where
is she?"</p>

<p>"She got tired of waiting for you, and went for
a walk in the wood."</p>

<p>"She might have waited."</p>

<p>"Well, yes. One would think she'd be accustomed
to it by now," said Isobel. Her tone was
lazily indolent, but her eyes were set on him
in mockery.</p>

<p>Harry looked at her with a sudden alertness.
He looked at her hard. "Accustomed to waiting
for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She was exasperating in her malicious
tranquillity, meaning more than she said, saying
nothing that he could lay hold of, quite grave,
and laughing at him.</p>

<p>"Any hidden meanings, Miss Vintry?" For, as
a fact, Harry had generally been punctual, and
knew it.</p>

<p>"Nothing but what's quite obvious," she retorted,
dexterously fencing.</p>

<p>"Or ought to be, to a man not so slow as
I am?"</p>

<p>"You slow, Mr. Harry! You're Meriton's
ideal of reckless dash!"</p>

<p>"Meriton's?"</p>

<p>"That's the name of the town, isn't it? Or did
you think I said London's?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_152" title="pg 152"></a>
Harry laughed, but he was stung; she put
him on his mettle. "Oh no, I understood your
emphasis."</p>

<p>"You needn't keep her waiting any longer&mdash;while
you talk about nothing to me. You'll find
her in the west wood&mdash;if you want to. She left
you that message."</p>

<p>Harry had no doubt of what she meant, yet she
had not spoken a word of it. The saying goes
that words are given us to conceal our thoughts;
has anybody ever ventured to say that lips and eyes
are? Her meaning carried without speech; understanding
it, Harry took fire.</p>

<p>"I won't be late again, Miss Vintry," he said.
"It would be a pity to disappoint Meriton in its
ideal!"</p>

<p>He would have liked to speak to her for a
moment sincerely, to ask her if she really thought&mdash;But
no, it could not be risked. She would make
him feel and look ridiculous. Asking her opinion
about the right moment to&mdash;to&mdash;to come up to the
scratch (he could find no more dignified phrase)!
Her eyes would never let him hear the end of that.</p>

<p>"Still lingering?" she said, stifling a yawn.
"While poor Vivien waits!"</p>

<p>There are unregenerate atavistic impulses; Harry
would dearly have liked to box her ears. "Meriton's
ideal" rankled horribly. What business was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_153" title="pg 153"></a>
it of hers? It could not concern her in the least&mdash;a
conclusion which made matters worse, since
disinterested criticism is much the more formidable.</p>

<p>"I can find her in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, if you look! Shall you be back to
tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll be back to tea, Miss Vintry. Both
of us&mdash;together!"</p>

<p>Isobel smiled lazily again. "Come, you are
going to make an effort. Nothing of the laggard
now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the word you've been thinking suits
me?"</p>

<p>"It really will if you don't get to the west wood
soon."</p>

<p>"I'll get there&mdash;and be back&mdash;in half an hour."</p>

<p>The one thing he could not endure was that any
woman&mdash;above all, an attractive woman&mdash;should
find in him, Harry Belfield, anything that was
ridiculous. She might chide, she might admire;
laugh she must not, or her laugh should straightway
be confounded. Isobel's hint that he had
been a laggard in love banished, in a moment,
the uncongenial prudence which he had been
enforcing on himself.</p>

<p>She watched him with a contemptuous smile as
he strode off on his quest. Why had she mocked,
why had she hinted? In part for pure mockery's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_154" title="pg 154"></a>
sake. She found a malicious pleasure in giving his
complacency a dig, in shaking up his settled good
opinion of himself. In part from sheer impatience
of the simple obvious love affair, to which she was
called by her situation to play witness, chaperon,
and practically accomplice. It was quite clear how
it was going to end&mdash;better have the end at once!
Her smile of contempt had been not so much for
Harry as for the business on which he was engaged;
yet Harry had his share of it, since her
veiled banter had such power to move him. But
that same thing in him had its fascination; there
was a great temptation to exercise her power when
the man succumbed to it so easily. In this case
she had used it only to send him a little faster
whither he was going already; but did that touch
the limits of it?</p>

<p>So she speculated within herself, yet not quite
candidly. Her feeling for Harry was far from
being all contempt. She mocked him with her
"Meriton ideal," but she was not independent
of the Meriton standard herself. To her as to
the rest of his neighbours he was a bright star;
to her as to them his looks, his charm, his accomplishments
appealed. In her more than in most
of them his emotions, so ready and quick to take
fire, found a counterpart. To her more than to
most of them indifference from him seemed in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_155" title="pg 155"></a>
some sort a slight, a slur, a mark of failure.
Unconsciously she had fallen into the Meriton
way of thinking that notice from Harry Belfield
was a distinction, his favour a thing marking off
the recipient from less happy mortals. She had
received little notice and little favour&mdash;a crumb
or two of flirtation, flung from Vivien's rich table!</p>

<p>To Vivien, after all the person most intimately
concerned, Harry had seemed no laggard; she
would have liked him none the worse if he had
shown more of that quality. Nothing that he
did could be wrong, but some things could be&mdash;and
were&mdash;alarming. Her fastidiousness was not
hurt, but her timidity was aroused. She feared
crises, important moments, the crossing of Rubicons,
even when the prospect looked fair and delightful
on the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>To-day, in the west wood, the crossing had to
be made. It by no means follows that the man
who falls in love lightly makes love lightly; he
is as much possessed by the feeling he has come
by so easily as though it were the one passion
of a lifetime. In his short walk from Isobel
Vintry's side to Vivien's, Harry's feelings had
found full time to rise to boiling-point. Isobel
was far out of his mind; already it seemed to
him inconceivable that he should not, all along,
have meant to make his proposal&mdash;to declare his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_156" title="pg 156"></a>
love&mdash;to-day. How could he have thought to
hold it in for an hour longer?</p>

<p>"I know I was late, Vivien," he said. "I'm so
sorry. But&mdash;well, I half believe I was on purpose."
He was hardly saying what was untrue;
he was coming to half-believe it&mdash;or very nearly.</p>

<p>"On purpose! O Harry! Didn't you want
to give me my lesson to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not in bicycling," he answered, his eyes set
ardently on her face.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the trunk of a fallen tree,
which had been stripped of its bark and shaped
into a primitive bench. He sat down by her
and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Your hand shakes! What's the matter?
You're not afraid of me?"</p>

<p>"Not of you&mdash;no, not of you, Harry."</p>

<p>"Of something then? Is it of something I
might do&mdash;or say?" He raised her hand to his
lips and kissed it.</p>

<p>It was no use trying to get answers out of her;
she was past that; but she did not turn away from
him, she let her eyes meet his in a silent appeal.</p>

<p>"Vivien, I love you more than all my life!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you can't," he could just hear her
murmur, her lips scarcely parted.</p>

<p>"More than everything in the world besides!"</p>

<p>What wonderful words they were. "More
<a class="pagenum" id="page_157" title="pg 157"></a>
than everything in the world besides!" "More
than all my life!" Could there be such words?
Could she have heard&mdash;and Harry uttered them?
Her hands trembled violently in his; she was sore
afraid amidst bewildering joy. Anything she had
foreshadowed in her dreams seemed now so faint,
so poor, against marvellous reality. Surely the
echo of the wonderful words would be in her
ears for all her life!</p>

<p>She had none wherewith to answer them; her
hands were his already; for the tears in her eyes
she could hardly see his face, but she turned her
lips up to his in mute consent.</p>

<p>"That makes you mine," said Harry, "and me
yours&mdash;yours only&mdash;for ever."</p>

<p>She released her hands from his, and put her
arm under his arm. Still she said nothing, but
now she smiled beneath her dim eyes, and pressed
his arm.</p>

<p>"Not frightened now?" he asked softly. "You
need never be frightened again."</p>

<p>She spoke at last just to say "No" very softly,
yet with a wealth of confident happiness.</p>

<p>"The things we'll do, the things we'll see, the
times we'll have!" cried Harry gaily. "And to
think that it's only a month or two ago that the
idea occurred to me!" He teased her. "Occurred
to us, Vivien?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_158" title="pg 158"></a>
"Oh no, Harry. Well, then, yes." She laughed
lightly, pressing his arm again. "But never that
it could be like this."</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;nice?" he asked in banter.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;real?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's real and it's nice&mdash;real nice, in fact,"
laughed Harry.</p>

<p>"Don't talk just for a little while," she begged,
and he humoured her, watching her delicate face
during the silence she entreated. "You must tell
them," she said suddenly, with a return of her
alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I'll do all the hard work," he promised
her, smiling.</p>

<p>She fell into silence again, the wonderful words
re-echoing in her ears&mdash;"More than everything in
the world besides!" "More than all my life!"</p>

<p>"I promised Miss Vintry we'd be back to tea.
Do you think you can face her?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, with you. But you've got to tell. You
promised."</p>

<p>"You'll have somebody to help you over all the
stiles&mdash;now and hereafter."</p>

<p>The suggestion brought a radiant smile of
happiness to her lips; it expressed to her the
transformation of her life. So many things had
been stiles to her, and her father's gospel was
that people must get over their own stiles for
<a class="pagenum" id="page_159" title="pg 159"></a>
themselves; that was the lesson he inculcated,
with Isobel Vintry to help him. But now&mdash;well,
if stiles were still possible things at all, with Harry
to help her over they lost all their terrors.</p>

<p>"We'll remember this old tree-trunk. In fact
I think that the proper thing is to carve our initials
on it&mdash;two hearts and our initials. That's real
keeping company!"</p>

<p>"Oh no," she protested with a merry little
laugh. "Keeping company! Harry!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll let you off the hearts, but I must
have the initials&mdash;very, very small. Do let me
have the initials!"</p>

<p>"Somewhere where nobody will look, nobody
be likely to see them!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I'll find a very secret place! And
once a year&mdash;on the anniversary, if we're here&mdash;we'll
come and freshen them up with a penknife."</p>

<p>He had his out now, and set about his pleasant
silly task, choosing one end of the tree-trunk, near
to the ground, where, in fact, nobody who was not
in the secret would find the record.</p>

<p>"There you are&mdash;a beautiful monogram; 'H'
and 'V' intertwined. I'm proud of that!"</p>

<p>"So am I&mdash;very proud, Harry!" she said softly,
taking his arm as they moved away. Was she not
blessed among the daughters of women? To say
nothing of being the envy of all Meriton!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_160" title="pg 160"></a>
And for Harry the past was all over, the dead
had buried its dead. The new life&mdash;and the life
of the new man&mdash;had begun.</p>

<p>Wellgood was back from a ride round his farms&mdash;a
weekly observance with him. He had been
grimly encouraging the good husbandmen, badly
scaring the inefficient, advising them all to keep
their labourers in order, and their womankind as
near to reason as could be hoped for. Now he had
his hour of relaxation over tea. He was a great
tea-drinker&mdash;four or five cups made his allowance.
Tea is often the libertinism of people otherwise
severe. He leant back in his garden-chair, his
gaitered legs outstretched, and drank his tea,
Isobel Vintry replenishing the swiftly-emptied cup.
She performed the office absent-mindedly&mdash;with an
air of detachment which hinted that she would fulfil
her duties, routine though they might be, but must
not be expected to think about them.</p>

<p>"Where's Vivien?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"In the west wood&mdash;with Mr. Harry. He said
they'd be back for tea."</p>

<p>"Oh!" He finished his third cup and handed
the vessel over to her to be refilled. "Things
getting on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Here's your tea."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so? Give me another
lump of sugar."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_161" title="pg 161"></a>
"Sugar at that rate'll make you put on too much
weight. Well, I gave him a hint that the pear
was ripe."</p>

<p>"You did? Well, I'm hanged!"</p>

<p>"You think I'm very impudent?"</p>

<p>"What did you say? But I daresay you said
nothing. You've a trick with those eyes of yours,
Isobel."</p>

<p>"I've devoted them solely to supervising your
daughter's education, Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" he chuckled. He liked impudence
from a woman; to primitive man&mdash;Wellgood had
a good leaven of the primitive&mdash;it is an agreeable
provocation.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you," she said&mdash;with her challenging
indolence that seemed to say "Disturb me if you
can!"&mdash;"I'll bet you we hear of the engagement
in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"You know a lot about it! What'll you
bet me?"</p>

<p>"Anything you like&mdash;from a quarter's salary
downwards!" said Isobel. She sat facing the path
from the west wood. On it she saw two figures,
arm in arm. Wellgood had his back turned that
way. The situation was favourable for Isobel's
bet.</p>

<p>A light hand in flirtation could not be expected
from a man to whom the heavy hand&mdash;the strong
<a class="pagenum" id="page_162" title="pg 162"></a>
decisive grip&mdash;was gospel in matters public and
private. Besides, he had grown impatient; his
affair waited on Harry's.</p>

<p>"From a quarter's salary downwards? Will you
bet me a kiss?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she smiled, "if losing means the kiss.
Because I know I shall win, Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>Harry and Vivien came near, still exalted in
dreams, the new man and the girl transformed.
Wellgood had not noticed them, perhaps would
have forgotten them anyhow.</p>

<p>"If winning meant the kiss?" he said.</p>

<p>"I don't bet as high as that, except on a certainty,"
smiled Isobel. "Another cup?"</p>

<p>"No, but I tell you, Isobel&mdash;" He leant over
the table towards her.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me, and don't touch me! They're
just behind you, Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>He swore under his breath. A plaguy mean
trick this of women's&mdash;defying just when they are
safe! He had to play the father&mdash;and the father-in-law
to be; to seem calm, wise, benevolent,
paternally affectionate, patronizing to young love
from the sage eminence of years that he was just,
a second ago, forgetting.</p>

<p>Since she had come into his house, to be Vivien's
companion and exemplar, a year ago, they had had
many of these rough defiant flirtations. He was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_163" title="pg 163"></a>
not easily snubbed, she not readily frightened.
They had worked together over Vivien's rather
severe training in a matter-of-fact way; but there
had been this diversion for hours of leisure. Why
not? Flirtation of this order was not the conventional
thing between the girl's father and the
girl's companion. No matter! They were both
vigorously self-confident people; the flirtation
suited the taste of at least one of them, and served
the ends of both.</p>

<p>The near approach of the lovers&mdash;the imminence
of a declared engagement&mdash;made a change. Wellgood
advanced more openly; Isobel challenged
and repelled more impudently. The moment for
which he had waited seemed near at hand; she
suffered under an instinctive impulse to prove that
she too had her woman's power and could use
it. But, deep down in her mind, the proof was
more for Harry's enlightenment than for Wellgood's
subjugation. She had an overwhelming
desire not to appear, in Harry's conquering eyes, a
negligible neglected woman. She mocked the
Meriton standard&mdash;but shared it.</p>

<p>"Look round!"</p>

<p>He obeyed her.</p>

<p>"Arm in arm!"</p>

<p>He started, and glowered at the approaching
couple. Vivien hastily dropped Harry's arm.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_164" title="pg 164"></a>
"Oh, that's nothing&mdash;she's just afraid! It's
settled all the same. And within my ten minutes!"</p>

<p>"Aye, you're a&mdash;!" He smiled in grim fierce
admiration.</p>

<p>"Shall I take three months' notice, Mr. Wellgood?"
She was lying back in her chair again,
insolent and serenely defiant. "I might have
betted after all, and been quite safe," she said.</p>

<p>Harry victorious in conquest, Vivien with her
more precious conquest in surrender, were at Wellgood's
elbow. He had to wrench himself away
from his own devices.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you got to say, Vivien?" he
asked his daughter rather sharply. She was looking
more than usually timid. What was there to
be frightened at?</p>

<p>"She hasn't got anything to say," Harry interposed
gaily. "I'm going to do the talking.
Are you feeling romantic to-day, Mr. Wellgood?"</p>

<p>Wellgood smiled sourly. "You know better
than to try that on me, Master Harry."</p>

<p>"Yes! Well, I'll cut that, but I just want to
mention&mdash;as a matter of business, which may affect
your arrangements&mdash;that Vivien has promised to
marry me."</p>

<p>Vivien had stolen up to her father and now laid
her hand lightly on his shoulder. He looked at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_165" title="pg 165"></a>
her with a kindly sneer, then patted her hand.
"You like the fellow, do you, Vivien?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Then I daresay we can fix matters up. Shake
hands, Harry."</p>

<p>Vivien kissed his forehead; the two men shook
hands.</p>

<p>"I daresay you're not exactly taken by surprise,"
said Harry, laughing. "I've been calling rather
often!"</p>

<p>"It had struck me that something was up."</p>

<p>Wellgood was almost genial; he was really
highly pleased. The match was an excellent one
for his daughter; he liked Harry, despite a lurking
suspicion that he was "soft;" and the way now lay
open for his own plan.</p>

<p>"You haven't asked me for my congratulations,
Vivien," said Isobel.</p>

<p>Vivien went over to her and kissed her, then sat
down by the table, her eyes fixed on Harry. She
was very quiet in her happiness; she felt so peaceful,
so secure. Such was the efficacy of those
wonderful words!</p>

<p>"And I wish you all happiness too, Mr. Harry,"
Isobel went on with a smile. "Perhaps you'll forgive
me if I say that I'm not altogether taken by
surprise either?"</p>

<p>Harry did not quite like her smile; there seemed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_166" title="pg 166"></a>
to be a touch of ridicule about it. It covertly
reminded him of their talk before tea, before he
went to the west wood.</p>

<p>"I never had much hope of blinding your eyes,
so I didn't even try, Miss Vintry."</p>

<p>"I was thinking it must come to a head soon,"
she remarked.</p>

<p>Harry flushed ever so slightly. She was hinting
at the laggard in love again; it almost seemed
as if she were hinting that she had brought the
affair to a head. In the west wood he had forgotten
her subtle taunt; he had thought of
nothing but his passion, and how impatient it was.
Now he remembered, and knew that he was being
derided, even in his hour of triumph. He felt
another impulse of anger against her. This time
it took the form of a desire to show her that he
was no fool, not a man a woman could play with
as she chose. He would like to show her what a
dangerous game that was. He was glad when,
having shot her tiny sharp-pointed dart, she rose
and went into the house. "You'll want to talk it
all over with Mr. Wellgood!" He did not want
to think of her; only of Vivien.</p>

<p>"Poor Isobel!" said Vivien. "She's very nice
about it, isn't she? Because she can't really be
pleased."</p>

<p>Both men looked rather surprised; each was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_167" title="pg 167"></a>
roused from his train of thought. Both had been
thinking about Isobel, but the thoughts of neither
consorted well with Vivien's "Poor Isobel!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"It means the loss of her situation, Harry."</p>

<p>"Of course! I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Don't you young people be in too great a
hurry," said Wellgood, with the satisfied smile of
a man with a secret. "You're not going to be
married the day after to-morrow! There's lots of
time for something to turn up for Isobel. She
needn't be pitied. Perhaps she may be tired of
you and your ways, young woman, and glad to
be rid of her job!"</p>

<p>"Lucky there's somebody ready to take her
place, then, isn't it?" laughed Harry.</p>

<p>Wellgood laughed too as he rose. "It seems
very lucky all round," he said, smiling again as he
left them. He was quite secure that they would
spend no time in thinking about good luck other
than their own.</p>

<p>The lovers sat on beside the water till twilight
fell, talking of a thousand things, yet always of one
thing&mdash;of one thing through which they saw all
the thousand other things, and saw them transfigured
with the radiance of the one. Even the
bright hues of Harry's future grew a hundredfold
brighter when beheld through this enchanted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_168" title="pg 168"></a>
medium, while Vivien's simple ideal of life seemed
heaven realized. Visions were their only facts, and
dreams alone their truth. Neither from without
nor from within could aught harm the airy fabric
that they built&mdash;Vivien out of ignorance, Harry by
help of that fine oblivion of his.</p>

<p>For a long while Isobel Vintry&mdash;fled to her
room lest Wellgood should seek her&mdash;watched
them from her window with envious eyes. For
them the dreams; for her, most uninspiring
reality! At last she turned away with a weary
impatient shrug.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good thing to have it over and
done with, anyhow!" she exclaimed, and smiled
once more to think how she had stung Harry
Belfield with her insinuations and her "Meriton
ideal." If we cannot be happy ourselves, it is a
temptation to make happy people a little uncomfortable.
In that lies an evidence of power
consolatory to the otherwise unfortunate.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX.<a class="pagenum" id="page_169" title="pg 169"></a></h2>

<h2>"INTERJECTION."</h2>

<p>Settling the question of the butcher's shop
had seemed to Andy Hayes like a final solution
of life's problems. Therein he showed the
quality of his mind. One thing at a time, settle
that. As he had learnt to say 'on the other
side,' "Don't look for trouble!" He had yet to
realize what the man of imagination knows instinctively&mdash;that
the problems of life end only
with life itself.</p>

<p>An eight-ten train to town is not, however,
favourable to such a large and leisurely survey as
a consideration of life in its totality. It involved
a half-hour's race for the station. And this morning
the Bird&mdash;standing at the door of his father's
hostelry&mdash;delayed a hard-pressed man who had
absolutely no time to stop.</p>

<p>"Heard the news about Mr. Harry?" cried the
Bird across the street.</p>

<p>Andy slowed down. "About Harry?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_170" title="pg 170"></a>
"Engaged to Miss Wellgood!" shouted the
Bird.</p>

<p>"No, is he?" yelled Andy in reply. "Hurrah!"</p>

<p>It was but two days after the great event had
happened. Recently Andy had seen nothing of
his Meriton friends. He had been working early
and late in town; down at seven-thirty, up to work
again at eight-ten. He had been a very draught-horse,
straining at a load which would not move&mdash;straining
at it on a slippery slope. Business was
so "quiet." Could not work command success?
At present he had to be content with the meagre
consolation proffered to Sempronius. He must
be at the office not a second later than nine. If
the American letters came in, replies could get off
by the same day's mail.</p>

<p>Yet the news of the engagement&mdash;he wished he
could have had it from Harry's own lips&mdash;cut
clean across his personal preoccupations. How
right! How splendid! Dear old Harry! And
how he would like to congratulate Miss Vivien!
All that on Saturday afternoon or Sunday. Andy
was one of the world's toilers; for them works of
charity, friendship, and love have for the most part
to wait for Saturday afternoon or Sunday; the
other five days and a half&mdash;it's the struggle for life,
grimly individual.</p>

<p>He loved Harry Belfield, and stored up untold
<a class="pagenum" id="page_171" title="pg 171"></a>
enthusiasm for Saturday afternoon or Sunday&mdash;those
altruistic hours when we have time to consider
our own souls and other people's fortunes.
But to-day was only Thursday; Thursday is well
in the zone of the struggle. Andy's timber
business was&mdash;just turning the corner! So many
businesses always are. Shops expensively installed,
hotels over-built, newspapers&mdash;above all, newspapers&mdash;started
with a mighty flourish of heavy
dividends combined with national regeneration&mdash;they
are all so often just turning the corner. The
phrase signifies that you hope you are going to
lose next year rather less than you lost last year.
If somebody will go on supplying the deficit&mdash;in
that sanguine spirit which is the strength of a
commercial nation&mdash;or can succeed in inducing
others to supply it in a similar spirit, the corner
may in the end be turned. If not, you stay this
side of the magical corner of success, and presently
find yourself in another&mdash;to be described as
"tight." A life-long experience of questions&mdash;of
problems and riddles&mdash;was not, for Andy Hayes,
to stop short at the felicitous solution of the
puzzle about Jack Rock's butcher's shop in
Meriton High Street.</p>

<p>Andy had to postpone reflection on Harry
Belfield's happiness and Vivien's emancipation.
Yet he had a passing appreciation of the end of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_172" title="pg 172"></a>
ordeals&mdash;of Curly, cross-country rides, and the
like. Would the mail from Montreal bring a
remittance for the rent of the London office? The
other business men in the fast morning train were
grumpy. Money was tight, the bank rate stiff,
times bad. No moment to launch out! There
were sounded all the familiar jeremiads of the City
train. What could you expect with a Liberal
Government in office? The stars in their courses
fought against business. Nobody would trust
anybody. It was not that nobody had the money&mdash;nobody
ever has&mdash;but hardly anybody was
believed to be able, in the last resort, to get it.
That impression spells collapse. The men in the
first-class carriage&mdash;Andy had decided that it was
on the whole "good business" to stand himself a
first-class "season"&mdash;seemed well-fed, affluent,
possessed of good cigars; yet they were profoundly
depressed, anticipative of little less than
imminent starvation. One of them explicitly
declared his envy of a platelayer whom the train
passed on the line.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two bob a week certain," he said.
"Better than losing a couple of hundred pounds,
Jack. Not much longer hours either, and an
open-air life!"</p>

<p>"Well, take it on," Jack, who had a cynical
turn of humour, advised. "He (the platelayer
<a class="pagenum" id="page_173" title="pg 173"></a>
he meant) couldn't very well lose more than you
do; and you'll never make more than he does.
Swap!"</p>

<p>The first speaker retired behind the <i>Telegraph</i>
in some disgust. It is hard to meet a rival wit
as early as eight-thirty in the morning.</p>

<p>The American mail was not in when Andy
reached Dowgate Hill, in which important locality
he occupied an insignificant attic. A fog off the
coast of Ireland accounted for the delay. But
on his table, as indicated by the small boy who
constituted his staff&mdash;the staff would, of course,
be larger when that corner was turned&mdash;lay a
cable. There was no other correspondence. Things
were quiet. Andy could not suppress a reflection
that a rather later train would have done as well.
Still there was a cable; no doubt it advised
the remittance. The remittance was a matter of
peremptory necessity, unless Andy were to empty
his private pocket.</p>

<p>"Incontestable&mdash;Incubation&mdash;Ineffective." So
ran the cable.</p>

<p>Andy scratched his nose and reached for the
code.</p>

<p>If ever a digression were allowable, if expatiation
on human fortune and vicissitudes were still the
fashion, what a text lies in the cable code! This
cold-blooded provision for all emergencies, this
<a class="pagenum" id="page_174" title="pg 174"></a>
business-like abbreviation of tragedy! "Asbestos"
means "Cannot remit." "Despairing" signifies
"If you think it best." (Could despair sound
more despairing?) "Patriotic&mdash;Who are the
heaviest creditors?" Passing to other fields of
life: "Risible&mdash;Doctor gives up hope." "Refreshing&mdash;Sinking
steadily; prepare for the worst."
"Resurrection&mdash;There is no hope of recovery."
"Resurgam&mdash;Realization of estate proceeding
satisfactorily."</p>

<p>The cable code is a masterly epitome of life.</p>

<p>However Andy Hayes was not given to digression
or to expatiation. Patiently he turned
the leaves to find the interpretation of his own
three mystic words.</p>

<p>The result was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"Incontestable&mdash;Incubation&mdash;Ineffective."</p>

<p>Which being interpreted ran: "Most essential
to retrench all unnecessary expense. Cannot see
prospects of your branch becoming paying proposition.
Advise you to close up and return as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>There was a fourth word. The "operator"&mdash;Andy
still chose in his mind the transatlantic
term&mdash;had squeezed it into a corner, so that it did
not at first catch the reader's notice. "Infusoria."
Andy turned up "Infusoria." It was a hideously
uncompromising word, as the code rendered it;
<a class="pagenum" id="page_175" title="pg 175"></a>
the code makes a wonderful effort sometimes.
"Infusoria" meant: "We expect you to act on
this advice at once, and we cannot be responsible
for expenditure beyond what is strictly necessary
to wind up."</p>

<p>Andy did not often smoke in his office in
business hours, but he had a cigarette now.</p>

<p>"Well, that's pretty straight," he thought. The
instructions were certainly free from ambiguity.
"Made a failure of it!" The cigarette tended
to resignation. "Needed a cleverer fellow than
I am to make it go." This was his usual sobriety
of judgment. "Rather glad to be out of it."
That was the draught-horse's instinctive cry of joy
at being released from a hopeless effort. They
were right on the other side&mdash;it was not a "paying
proposition." He was good at seeing facts; they
did not offend him. So many people are offended
at facts&mdash;really a useless touchiness.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Andy, flinging the end of
the cigarette into the grate, and taking up that
fateful code again.</p>

<p>"Passionately" met his need: "Will act on
instructions received without delay and with all
possible saving of expense."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Andy, his stylograph moving in
mid-air. He turned over the pages again,
seeking another word, thinking very hard
<a class="pagenum" id="page_176" title="pg 176"></a>
whether he should send that other word when
he found it.</p>

<p>The word was "Interjection." It meant: "My
personal movements uncertain. Will advise you
of them at the earliest moment possible."</p>

<p>To cable "Interjection" would mean an admission
of considerable import, both to his principals
in Montreal and to himself. It would imply that
he was thinking of cutting adrift. Andy was
thinking terribly hard about it. It might cause
his principals to consider that he was taking too
much on himself. Andy was not a partner; he
was only on a salary, with a small contingent profit
from commissions. It seemed complimentary&mdash;and
delusive&mdash;now to call the profit contingent;
the salary was all he had in the world. Such an
independently minded word as "Interjection" incurred
a risk. Before he had done thinking about
cutting adrift, he might find himself cut adrift.
The principals were peremptory men. In view of
his failure to make the London branch a "paying
proposition," perhaps he was lucky in that he had
not been cut adrift already. There was a code
word for that&mdash;"Seltzer." It meant, "We shall
be able to dispense with your services on the &mdash;&mdash;
prox."</p>

<p>"Seltzer thirtieth" would have thrown&mdash;and
might still throw&mdash;Andy on the mercy of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_177" title="pg 177"></a>
world. Turning up the code (if you are not
thoroughly familiar with it) may be interesting
work&mdash;"as exciting as any novel," as reviewers
kindly say of books of travel.</p>

<p>Andy had suddenly, and with some surprise,
become aware how very much he wished not to
go back to Montreal, pleasant city as it is. When
he was puzzling about the Meriton shop, Canada
had stood for freedom, scope, and opportunity.
Why should it not stand for them still, just as
well as, or better than, London? Canada and
London had ranked together then, in sharp
opposition to the narrow limits of his native town.
Nobody could deny the scope and the opportunities
of Canada. But Andy did not want to go back.
He was profoundly apologetic to himself about
the feeling; he would not have ventured to justify
it; it was wrong. But, after his long exile, his
native land had laid hold on him&mdash;England with
her ripe rich sweetness, London baited with a
thousand lures. He had no pluck, no grit, no
go; so he said to himself. There were fortunes
to be made over there&mdash;a mighty nation to help
in building up. That was all true, but he did not
want to go. The stylograph hung longingly over
the cable form; it wanted to write "Interjection."</p>

<p>The fog had apparently been very persistent in
the Irish Channel, for no mail came; the principals
<a class="pagenum" id="page_178" title="pg 178"></a>
in Montreal seemed quite right about the London
branch, for no business offered. At half-past
twelve Andy determined to go out for lunch and
a walk. By the time he got back the mail might
have come&mdash;and he might have made up his mind
whether or not to cable "Interjection."</p>

<p>A man who has it in mind to risk his livelihood
often decides that he may as well treat himself
liberally at lunch or dinner. Monte Carlo is a
terribly expensive place to stay at if you do not
gamble; if you do, it costs nothing&mdash;at least,
what it costs does not matter, which comes to the
same thing. Andy decided that, having two hours
off, he would go west for lunch. His thoughts
were on the great restaurant by the river. If he
were really leaving London in a week (obedient to
"Infusoria"), it would be interesting to go there
once again.</p>

<p>Entering the grill-room, on his left as he came
in from the Strand (at the last moment the main
restaurant had struck him as absurd for his chop),
he was impressed by the air of habituality worn
by his fellow-guests. What was humdrum to
them was a treat to him, their routine his adventure.
They knew the waiters, knew the ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel, and inquired after the cook. They knew
one another too, marking who was there to-day,
who was an absentee. Andy ate his chop, with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_179" title="pg 179"></a>
his mouth healthily hungry, with his eyes voracious
of what passed about him.</p>

<p>He sat near a glass screen some six or seven
feet high, dividing the room in two. Suddenly
from the other side of it came a voice:</p>

<p>"Hallo, is that you, Hayes? Come and have
your coffee with us. Where have you been all
this time?"</p>

<p>There they sat&mdash;and there they might have
been sitting ever since Andy parted from them,
so much at home they looked&mdash;Billy Foot, the
Nun, and Miss Dutton. Another young man was
with them, completing the party. He was plump,
while Billy was thin&mdash;placid, while Billy always
suggested a reserve of excitement; but he had a
likeness to Billy all the same.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, may I come?" cried Andy, boyishly
loud; but the luck of meeting these friends again
was too extraordinary. He trotted round the
glass screen with his tumbler in his hand; he had
not quite finished his lager beer.</p>

<p>"Chair and coffee for Mr. Hayes," said Billy
Foot. "You remember him, girls? My brother,
Hayes&mdash;Gilly, Mr. Hayes. How did you leave
Harry?"</p>

<p>"How awfully funny I should meet you!"
gasped Andy.</p>

<p>"It's not funny if you ever come here," observed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_180" title="pg 180"></a>
Miss Dutton; "because we come here
nearly every day&mdash;with somebody." She was
more sardonic than ever.</p>

<p>The Nun&mdash;she was not, by the way, a Nun any
longer, but a Quaker girl ("All in the same line,"
her manager said, with a fine indifference to the
smaller theological distinctions), and now sang of
how, owing to her having to wear sombre garments
(expressed by a charming dove-tinted
costume that sent the stalls mad), she had lost
her first and only love&mdash;the Nun smiled at Andy
in a most friendly fashion.</p>

<p>"I'd quite forgotten you," she remarked, "but
I'm glad to see you again. Let's see, you're&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Harry Belfield's friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, you're Mr. Hayes. Oh, I remember
you quite well. Been away since?"</p>

<p>"No, I've been here. I mean&mdash;at work, and
so on."</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" sighed the Nun (Andy ventured
to call her the Nun in his thoughts, though she
had changed her persuasion). She seemed to
express a gentle resignation to not being able to
keep track of people; she met so many, coming
every day to the restaurant.</p>

<p>"I ask five, I want four, but with just the right
fellow I'd take three," said Billy's brother Gilly,
apparently continuing a conversation which seemed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_181" title="pg 181"></a>
to interest nobody but himself; for the Nun was
looking at neighbouring hats, Miss Dutton had
relapsed into gloomy abstraction, and Billy was
thoughtfully revolving a small quantity of old
brandy round a very large glass. Gilly had an old
brandy too, but his attitude towards it was one
of studied neglect. His favourite vintage had
given out the year before, so his life was rather
desolate.</p>

<p>"Harry's engaged," Andy volunteered to the
Nun, glad to possess a remark of such commanding
interest.</p>

<p>"To a girl?" asked the Nun, absently and
without turning her face towards him.</p>

<p>"Well, of course!" said Andy. What else
could one be engaged to?</p>

<p>"Everybody comes to it," said Billy Foot.
"Take three, if you must, Gilly."</p>

<p>"At a push," said his brother sadly.</p>

<p>"I hate that hat on that woman," said the Nun
with a sudden vehemence, nodding her head at a
fat woman in a large purple erection. Hats moved
the Nun perhaps more than anything else in the
world.</p>

<p>"Rot, Doris," commented Miss Dutton. "It's
what they're wearing."</p>

<p>"But they aren't all as fat as that," the Nun
objected.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_182" title="pg 182"></a>
"Flourishing, Hayes?" asked Billy Foot.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather think I've just lost my job,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>"If you're looking out for a really sound way of
investing five thousand pounds&mdash;" Gilly began.</p>

<p>"Four to a gentleman," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Three to a friend," corrected the Nun.</p>

<p>"Oh, what the devil's the good of trying to talk
business here?" cried Gilly in vexation. "Only
a chance is a chance, you know."</p>

<p>Billy Foot saw that Andy was puzzled. "Gilly&mdash;my
brother, you know&mdash;I suppose I introduced
you?&mdash;has unfortunately come here with a problem
on his mind. I didn't know he had one, or I
wouldn't have asked him, because problems bore
the girls."</p>

<p>"No, they don't. It interests me to see you
trying to think." This, of course, from Miss
Dutton. The Nun, now imbibing an iced green
fluid through a straw, was sublimely abstracted.</p>

<p>"My brother," Billy resumed, with a glance of
protest towards his interruptor, "has, for some
reason or another, become a publisher. That's all
right. Not being an author, I don't complain.
Having done pretty badly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The public's no good," said Gilly gloomily.</p>

<p>"He wants to drag in some unfortunate person
to be his partner. I understand, Gilly, that, if
<a class="pagenum" id="page_183" title="pg 183"></a>
really well recommended, your accepted partner
can lose his time, and the rest of his money, for no
more than three thousand pounds&mdash;paid down on
the nail without discount?"</p>

<p>"You've a charming way of recommending the
project to Mr. Hayes' consideration," said Gilly,
in reproachful resignation.</p>

<p>"To my consideration," Andy exclaimed, laughing.
"What's it got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"It's a real chance," Gilly persisted. "And if
you're out of a job, and happen to be able to lay
your hands on five&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three!" whispered Billy.</p>

<p>"&mdash;thousand pounds, you might do worse
than look into it. Now, I must go," and with no
more than a nod to serve as farewell to all the
party he rose and sauntered slowly away. He had
not touched his brandy; his brother reached over
thoughtfully and appropriated it. "I may as well,
as I'm going to pay for it," he remarked.</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy found himself telling the Nun
all about his cable and his affairs. The other two
listened; all three were very friendly and sympathetic;
even Miss Dutton forbore to sneer.
Andy expanded in the kindly atmosphere of
interest. "I don't want to go back, you know,"
he said with a smile that appealed for understanding.
"But I must, unless something turns up."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_184" title="pg 184"></a>
"Well, why not talk to Gilly?" the Nun
suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, you go round and talk to Gilly," agreed
Billy. "Rotting apart, he's got a nice little
business, and one or two very good schemes on,
but he wants a bit more capital, as well as somebody
to help him. He doesn't look clever, but in five
years he's built up&mdash;yes, a tidy little business.
You wouldn't come to grief with Gilly."</p>

<p>"But I haven't got the money, or anything like
it. I've got nothing."</p>

<p>The Nun and Billy exchanged glances. The Nun
nodded to Billy, but he shook his head. Miss
Dutton watched them for a moment, then she
smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>"I don't mind saying it," she observed, and to
Andy's astonishment she asked him, "What
about your old friend the butcher?"</p>

<p>"How did you hear of that?"</p>

<p>"Harry Belfield was up one day last week
lunching here, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We were awfully amused," the Nun interrupted,
with her pretty rare gurgle. "If you'd done it,
we were all coming down to buy chops and give
you a splendid send-off. I rather wish you had."
The imagined scene amused the Nun very much.</p>

<p>"Jack Rock? Oh, I couldn't possibly ask him,
after refusing his offer!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_185" title="pg 185"></a>
"What did you say his name was?" the Nun
inquired.</p>

<p>Andy repeated the name, and the Nun nodded,
smiling still. Andy became portentously thoughtful.</p>

<p>"We have sown a seed!" said Billy Foot.
"I'll drop a word to Gilly to keep the offer open.
Now you must go, girls, because I've got some
work to do in the world, though you never seem
to believe it."</p>

<p>"Heavens, I must go too!" cried Andy, with a
horrified look at his watch.</p>

<p>"All right, you go," said Miss Dutton. "We
promised to meet a man here at half-past three and
go motoring."</p>

<p>"Did we? I don't believe we did," objected
the Nun. "I don't think I want to go."</p>

<p>"Then don't," said Miss Dutton. "I shall
go anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll wait and see the car," the Nun
conceded. She did not appear to have any
curiosity about its owner. "You really must come
and see me&mdash;and don't go back to Canada!" she
called after Andy. Then, when she was alone with
her friend, she said, "No, I shan't come motoring,
Sally, I shall go home and write a letter. So
much trouble is caused in this world by people
being afraid to do the obvious thing. Now I'm
never afraid to do the obvious thing."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_186" title="pg 186"></a>
"That's just what you said the night you found
me&mdash;and took me home with you," said Miss
Dutton. She spoke very low, and her voice was
strangely soft.</p>

<p>"It was the obvious thing to do, and I did it,"
the Nun pursued, shaking her head at Sally in
mild rebuke of an uncalled-for touch of sentiment.
"I shall do the obvious thing now. I shall write
to Mr. Jack Rock."</p>

<p>"You'll get yourself into a row, meddling with
other people's business."</p>

<p>"Oh no, I shan't," said the Nun serenely. "I
shall insist on a personal interview before my
action is condemned. I generally come out of
personal interviews all right."</p>

<p>"Arts and tricks!" said Sally scornfully.</p>

<p>"Just an innocent and appealing manner,"
smiled the Nun. "At any rate, this very afternoon
I write to Mr. Rock. He'll produce three
thousand pounds, Gilly will get a good partner,
Andy Hayes can stay in England, I shall feel I've
done a sensible thing. All that just by a letter!"
A thought struck her. "I may as well write it
here." She called a waiter and asked for notepaper
and the A B C railway guide. "Don't wait for me,
Sally. This letter will take some time to write."</p>

<p>"Not going to take it down yourself, are you?"
asked Sally, pointing to the A B C.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_187" title="pg 187"></a>
"Oh no. Messenger boy. With any luck, it'll
get there before Andy Hayes does. Rather fun if
Jack Rock plays up to me properly!"&mdash;and she
allowed herself the second gurgle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Sally stood looking at her with an apparently unwilling
smile. She loved her better than anybody
in the world, and would have died for her at that
or any other moment; but nothing of that sort
was ever said between them. They were almost
unsentimental enough to please Mark Wellgood
himself. Only the Nun did like her little plans to
be appreciated. Sally gave her all she wanted&mdash;a
sharp little bark of a laugh in answer to the gurgle&mdash;before
she walked away. The Nun settled to
her task in demure serenity, seeming (yet not
being) entirely unconscious of the extreme slowness
with which most of the young men passed her
table as they went out.</p>

<p>Billy Foot had walked with Andy as far as the
Temple and had reasoned with him. Yet Billy
himself admitted that there was great difficulty in
the case. Asked whether he himself would do what
he advised, he was forced to admit that he would
hesitate. Still he would not give up the idea; he
would see Gilly about it; perhaps the payment
could be "spread."</p>

<p>"It would have to be spread very thin before I
could pay it," smiled Andy ruefully. He gave
<a class="pagenum" id="page_188" title="pg 188"></a>
Billy Foot's hand a hearty squeeze when they
parted. "It's so awfully good of you to be so
interested&mdash;and of those nice girls too."</p>

<p>"Well, old chap, if we can help a pal!" said
Billy with a laugh. "Besides, it's good business
for Gilly too."</p>

<p>Andy went back to Dowgate Hill and climbed
up to his attic. The staff reported no callers in
his absence; the baleful cable lay still in possession
of the table. But Andy refused to be depressed.
His lunch had done him good. Steady and sober
as his mind was, yet he was a little infected by the
gay confidence that had reigned among his company.
They seemed all so sure that something would
turn up, that what they wanted would get itself
done somehow. Spoilt children of fate, the
brothers Foot and the Nun! Things they wanted
had come easily to them; they expected them to
come easily to their friends. The Nun in particular
appeared to treat fortune absolutely as a slave;
she was not even grateful; it was all too much a
matter of course that things should happen in the
way she wanted. He did not appreciate yet the
way in which the Nun assisted the course of events
sometimes.</p>

<p>Well, his reply to the cable must go. He took
up the form and read "Passionately." It was
significant of his changed mood&mdash;of what the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_189" title="pg 189"></a>
atmosphere of the lunch-party had done for him&mdash;that
he hesitated hardly more than one minute
before he added the possibly fateful "Interjection,"
and sent off the despatch before he had time again
to waver.</p>

<p>"If they choose to take offence&mdash;well, I can
make a living somehow, I suppose."</p>

<p>Andy's confidence in himself was slowly but
steadily ripening.</p>

<h2>Chapter X.<a class="pagenum" id="page_190" title="pg 190"></a></h2>

<h2>FRIENDS IN NEED.</h2>

<p>Old Jack Rock was, in his own phrase, "fair
tickled to death" at the whole thing. The
messenger boy reached him soon after five, just as
he was having his tea. It was not long before the
boy was having tea too&mdash;such a tea as seldom came
his way. Butter and jam together&mdash;why, jam on
cake, if he liked&mdash;and cream in his tea! Something
in that letter pleased the old gentleman
uncommon, thought the boy, as he watched Jack
chuckling over it, his forgotten bread-and-butter
half-way between plate and mouth.</p>

<p>"Doris Flower! Well now, that's a pretty
name," murmured Jack. "And I'll lay she's a
pretty girl!" He asked the boy whether she was
a pretty girl.</p>

<p>"'Er? Why, they're all mad about 'er," the
boy told him. "She's out o' sight, she is!"</p>

<p>"Writes a pretty letter too," said Jack, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_191" title="pg 191"></a>
started to read it all afresh. It was, indeed, a
persuasive letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <span class="smcap">"Dear Mr. Rock,</span>&mdash;I have heard so much that
is nice about you from our friends Harry Belfield
and your nephew (isn't he?) Mr. Hayes, that I
feel quite sure you will not mind my writing to
you. I know it is rather an unusual thing to do,
but I don't mind doing unusual things when
they're sensible, do you? Mr. Hayes was lunching
with us to-day, and he told us that something
had gone wrong with his business, and that he
would have to go back to Canada. I'm sure you
don't want him to go back to Canada any more
than we do. We like him so much, and you must
be very fond of him, aren't you? Well, by the
most wonderful chance, Billy Foot's brother (you
know Billy, don't you? He has been down to
Meriton, I know) was at lunch too&mdash;Gilly Foot.
Gilly has got a most tremendously good business
as a publisher, and he wants a partner. Wasn't it
lucky? Just as Mr. Hayes wants a new business,
Gilly Foot wants a partner! It might have been
arranged on purpose, mightn't it? And they took
to one another directly. I'm sure Gilly will be
delighted to take Mr. Hayes (That does sound
stiff&mdash;I think I shall say 'Andy'), and Andy&nbsp;(!)
would be delighted to join Gilly. There's only
<a class="pagenum" id="page_192" title="pg 192"></a>
one thing&mdash;Gilly must have a partner with some
money, and Andy says he hasn't got any. We
knew about you and all you had wanted to do for
him, so of course we said he must ask you to give
it to him or lend it to him; but he said he couldn't
possibly, as he had refused your previous offer. But
I'm sure you don't feel like that about it, do you?
I'm sure you would like to help him. And then
we could keep him here instead of his going back
to Canada; we should all be so pleased with that,
and so would you, wouldn't you? Do please do
it, dear Mr. Rock!</p>

<p>"I wonder if you know who I am. Perhaps
you've seen my picture in the papers? I'm
generally done as a Nun. Have you? I wonder
if you would ever care to hear me sing? If you
would, <i>do</i> let me know when you can come, and I
will send you a box. And you won't forget to
come round and see me in my dressing-room afterwards,
will you? It is so pleasant to see one's
friends afterwards; and I'll sing, oh, ever so
much better than usual for you!</p>

<p>"I told the boy to wait&mdash;just in case you wanted
to send an answer. I'm very excited and anxious!
It's three thousand pounds Gilly wants. It seems
to me an awful lot, but I don't know much about
publishing. Do forgive me, dear Mr. Rock, but
I was sure you would like to know, and I don't
<a class="pagenum" id="page_193" title="pg 193"></a>
believe Andy would have told you himself. Mind,
when you come to town&mdash;don't forget!&mdash;I am,
dear Mr. Rock, yours very sincerely,
<br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap author">"Doris Flower.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Some day soon, when I'm out motoring,
I may stop and see you&mdash;if you've been nice!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jack Rock's heart was very soft; his vanity was
also tickled. "Excited and anxious, is she? Bless
her! There'll be a rare talk in Meriton if she
comes to see old Jack!" He chuckled. "Me
go and sit in a box, and hear her sing! Asked to
her dressing-room too!"</p>

<p>The novel picture of himself was altogether too
much for Jack.</p>

<p>"As soon as you've done your tea, my lad, you
can take an answer."</p>

<p>Jack's epistolary style was of a highly polite but
rather unpractised order. He struggled between
his punctilious recognition of his own station and
the temptation of the Nun's friendliness&mdash;also
(perhaps by consequence) between the third, second,
and first grammatical persons:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. John Rock presents his respectful compliments
to Miss Doris Flower. Mr. Rock has
the matter of which Miss Flower is good enough
to write under his careful consideration. Mr. Rock
<a class="pagenum" id="page_194" title="pg 194"></a>
begs to assure you that he will do his best to
meet Miss Flower's wishes. There is nothing I
would not do for Andy, and I am sure that the
boy will prove himself deserving of Miss Flower's
kind interest. When next visiting London, Mr.
Rock will feel himself highly honoured by availing
himself of Miss Flower's much-esteemed invitation.
If Miss Flower should visit Meriton, he would be
very proud to welcome you at his house, next
door to the shop in High Street&mdash;anybody in
Meriton knows where that is; and I beg to remain,
dear madam, your most obedient servant to
command,<span class="smcap author">John Rock."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"You can take it," said Jack to the messenger
boy. "And here's half a crown for yourself."</p>

<p>The messenger boy was a London boy; his
professional belt was tight with tea; and half a
crown for himself! He put on his cap and stood
on the threshold. Escape was easy; he indulged
his native humour.</p>

<p>"From this"&mdash;he exhibited the half-crown&mdash;"and
your looks, gov'nor," he said, "I gather
that she's accepted ye! My best wishes for yer
'appiness!"</p>

<p>"Damn the boy!" said Jack, charging for the
door in an explosion of laughter. The boy was
already half-way down the street. "Hope my
<a class="pagenum" id="page_195" title="pg 195"></a>
letter was all right," Jack reflected, as he came
back, baulked of his prey. "May stop and see me,
may she! Bless her heart!"</p>

<p>Jack Rock felt that he had the chance of his life.
He also felt that he would like to obliterate what,
in his humility, he now declared to have been a
sad blunder&mdash;the offer of his butcher's shop. A
man like Andy, a lad with friends like that&mdash;Mr.
Harry Belfield, Mr. Foot, M.P., Mr. and Miss
Wellgood, above all this dazzling Miss Doris
Flower&mdash;to be the Meriton butcher! Perish the
thought! Publishing was a gentleman's business.
Aye, and his Andy should not go back to Canada.
If he did, old Jack felt that the best part of his
own life would be carried far away across the seas.</p>

<p>The thing should be done dramatically. "I'd
like Andy to have a story to tell her!" It was
not at all doubtful whom he meant by "her."</p>

<p>Nearly six&mdash;the bank was shut long ago. But
George Croton was a friend as well as a bank
manager; he would just have had tea. Jack
crossed the street and dropped in.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I can, Jack," said Mr. Croton,
wiping his bald head with a red handkerchief.
"You've securities lodged with us that more than
cover it. Draw your cheque. We won't wrong
you over the interest till you adjust the account.
Going to buy a Derby winner?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_196" title="pg 196"></a>
"I ain't so sure I'm not goin' to enter one,"
said Jack. He wrote his cheque. "That'll be all
right to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Unless our shutters are up, it will, Jack," Mr.
Croton jestingly replied.</p>

<p>"Thank God I've been a careful man," thought
old Jack. "One that knows a horse too! Her
talkin' about 'Andy'!" The Nun continued to
amuse and delight him immensely. Why, he'd
seen her picture on the hoardings last time he went
up to Tattersall's, to sell that bay filly! Lord,
not to have thought of that! That was her&mdash;the
Nun! He thought much more about Miss Flower
than about Andy as he took his way to Andy's
lodgings.</p>

<p>Andy was at home; he had been back from
town nearly an hour. But his own concerns
were quite out of his head. Harry Belfield had
been waiting for him&mdash;actually waiting, Harry the
Great!&mdash;and had hailed him with "I had to come
and tell you all about it myself, old fellow!"</p>

<p>In Andy's great devotion to Harry there was
mingled an element which seemed to himself
absurd, but which held its place obstinately&mdash;dim
and denied, yet always there. It was a sense of
something compassionate, something protective,
not diminishing his admiration but qualifying it;
making him not only believe that all would, but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_197" title="pg 197"></a>
also urgently pray that all might, go well with
Harry, that Harry might have everything that he
wished, possibly that Harry might wish the things
that he ought to have, though Andy's conscious
analysis of the feeling did not reach as far as this.
He would not only set his hero on a pedestal, he
would have the pedestal securely fenced round,
barricaded against danger, ensured against bombs;
even a screen against strong and sudden winds
might be useful to the statue.</p>

<p>The statue, it now appeared, had taken all these
precautions for itself. Vivien Wellgood was each
and all of these things&mdash;fence, screen, and barricade.
And many other things besides, such as
an ideal, an incentive, an inspiration. It was
among Harry's attractions that he was not in the
least ashamed of his emotions or shy about them.</p>

<p>"With the girls one meets in town it's a bargain,"
said Harry. "With her&mdash;oh, I can talk
to you, old man!&mdash;it really does seem a sort of
sacrament."</p>

<p>"I know. I mean I can imagine."</p>

<p>"Not things a fellow can talk about to everybody,"
Harry pursued. "Too&mdash;well, sacred,
you know. But when for absolutely the first
time in your life you feel the real thing, you
know the difference. The pater told me not to
be in a hurry about it; but a thing like that's just
<a class="pagenum" id="page_198" title="pg 198"></a>
the same now or a thousand years hence. It's
there&mdash;and that's all about it!"</p>

<p>Andy felt a little out of his depth. He had had
one fancy himself, but it had been nothing like so
wonderful as this.  It was Harry's privilege to be
able to feel things in that marvellous way. Andy
was not equal even to commenting on them.</p>

<p>"When are you going to be married?" he asked,
sticking to a matter-of-fact line of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Going to wait till October&mdash;rather a bore!
But here it's nearly July, and I've got my tour of
the Division fixed for September. After all, things
aren't so bad as they might be. And when I'm
through with the campaign&mdash;a honeymoon in Italy!
Pretty good, Andy?"</p>

<p>"Sounds all right," laughed Andy. "I expect I
shall have to send you my blessing from Montreal."</p>

<p>"From Montreal? What&mdash;you're not going
back?"</p>

<p>"The business is a frost in London, Harry;
and I've nothing else to look to."</p>

<p>"Lord, now, what a pity! Well, I'm sorry.
We shall miss you, Andy. Still, it's a ripping fine
country, isn't it? Mind you cable us congratulations!"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite certain about going yet," said
Andy. He felt rather like being seen off by the
train&mdash;very kindly.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_199" title="pg 199"></a>
"Oh, well, I hope you won't have to, old chap,
I really do. But it'll be better than the shop! I
say&mdash;I told Billy and the girls about that. They
roared."</p>

<p>"I know they did&mdash;I met them at lunch to-day."</p>

<p>"Had they heard about me?" Harry asked
rather eagerly. "Or did you tell them? What
did they say?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;awfully pleased," said Andy, rather
confused. It seemed strange to remember how
very little had been said on the wonderful topic.
Somehow they had wandered off to other things.</p>

<p>"I must give them all one more dinner," said
Harry, smiling, "before I settle down."</p>

<p>"Foot's brother was there&mdash;Gilly Foot&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did they ask what she was like?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't quite remember&mdash;everybody was
talking. Gilly Foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I expect they were a bit surprised, weren't
they?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they seemed surprised." Andy was
really trying to remember. "Yes, they did."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've got the character of a
marrying man," smiled Harry. "I hope you
told them I meant business?" Harry rose to his
feet with a laugh. "They used to rot a lot, you
know."</p>

<p>Harry was not to be got off the engrossing subject
<a class="pagenum" id="page_200" title="pg 200"></a>
of himself, his past, and his future; evidently
he could not imagine that the lunch-party had kept
off these subjects either. With a smile Andy made
up his mind not to trouble him with the matter of
Gilly Foot.</p>

<p>"I'll walk back with you as far as Halton gates,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No, you won't, old chap," laughed Harry.
"Vivien's been in the town and is going to call for
me here, and I'm going to walk with her as far as
Nutley gates&mdash;at least."</p>

<p>Voices came from outside. "Wish you good
evenin', miss!"&mdash;and a very timid "Good evening,
Mr. Rock." Vivien and Jack! How was Vivien
bearing the encounter?</p>

<p>"There she is!" cried Harry, and ran out of
the house, Andy following.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jack, how are you? Why, you're looking
like a two-year-old!"</p>

<p>Jack indeed looked radiant as he made bold to
offer his congratulations. He gave Harry his hand
and a hearty squeeze, then looked at Vivien tentatively.
She blushed, pulled herself together,
and offered Jack her hand. The feat accomplished,
she glanced quickly at Andy, blushing yet more
deeply. He knew what was in her mind, and
nodded his head at her in applause. In Harry's
cause she had touched a butcher.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_201" title="pg 201"></a>
"I like to see young folks happy. I like to see
'em get what they want, Mr. Harry."</p>

<p>"You see before you one at least who has, Jack.
I wonder if I may say two, Vivien? And I wish
I could say three, Andy."</p>

<p>"Maybe you wouldn't be so far wrong, Mr.
Harry," chuckled Jack. "But that's neither here
nor there, and I mustn't be keepin' you and your
young lady."</p>

<p>With blithe salutations the lovers went off.
Andy watched them; they were good to see. He
felt himself their friend&mdash;Vivien's as well as
Harry's, for Vivien trusted him with her shy confidences.
They were hard to leave&mdash;even as were
the delights of London with its lunch-parties and
the like.</p>

<p>"Going for a walk, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No, I want a talk with you, Andy." He led
the way in, and sat down at the table. "I've been
thinkin' a bit about you, Andy; so have some
others, I reckon. Mr. Belfield&mdash;he speaks high of
you&mdash;and there's others. There's no reason you
shouldn't take your part with the best of 'em.
Why, they feel that&mdash;they make you one of themselves.
So you shall be. I can't make you a rich
man, not as they reckon money, but I can help a bit."</p>

<p>"O Jack, you're always at it," Andy groaned
affectionately.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_202" title="pg 202"></a>
The old fellow's eyes twinkled as he drew out a
cheque and pushed it across the table.</p>

<p>"Put that in your pocket, and go and talk to
Mr. Foot's brother," he said.</p>

<p>Andy's start was almost a jump; old Jack's pent-up
mirth broke out explosively.</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this is supernatural!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>"Looks like it, don't it? How did I find out
about that? Well, it shows, Andy, that it's no
use you thinkin' of tryin' not to keep a certain
promise you made to me&mdash;because I find you
out!"</p>

<p>"Dear old Jack!" Andy was standing by him
now, his hand on his shoulder. "I don't believe
I could have kept the promise in this case. I think
I should have gone back&mdash;since the thing's no go
in London."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd have gone back&mdash;just like your
obstinate ways. But I found out. I've my
correspondents."</p>

<p>"But there's been no time! Well, you are one
too many for me, Jack!"</p>

<p>Jack's pride in his cunning was even greater
than his delight in his benevolence. "Perhaps
I've had a wireless telegram?" he suggested, wagging
his head. "Or a carrier pigeon? Who
knows?"</p>

<p>"But who was it told you?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_203" title="pg 203"></a>
"You've got some friends I didn't know of, up
there in London. Havin' your fling, are you,
Andy? That's right. And very good taste you
seem to have too." He nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I give it up," said Andy. "You're a
wizard, Jack."</p>

<p>"If you talk about a witch, you'll be a bit nearer
the point, I reckon. Not meanin' me, I need
hardly say! Well, I must let you into the secret."
With enormous pride he produced Miss Doris
Flower's letter. "Read that, my lad."</p>

<p>"The Nun!" cried Andy, as his eye fell on the
signature. "Who'd have thought of that?"</p>

<p>He read the letter; he listened to Jack's enraptured
story of how it had arrived. "And you're
not goin' to shame her by refusin' the money now,
are you?" asked cunning Jack. "If you do, you'll
make her feel she's been meddlin'. Nice thing to
make her feel that!"</p>

<p>Andy saw through this little device, but he only
patted Jack's shoulder again, saying quietly, "I'll
take the money, Jack." All the kindness made his
heart very full&mdash;whether it came from old-time
friends or these new friends from a new world who
made his cause theirs with so ready a sympathy.</p>

<p>"You're launched now, lad&mdash;fair launched!
And I know you'll float," said old Jack, grave at
last, as he took his leave, his precious letter most
<a class="pagenum" id="page_204" title="pg 204"></a>
carefully stowed away in his breast-pocket. It had
been a great day for Jack, great for what he had
done, great for the way in which his doing it had
come about.</p>

<p>Within less than twenty-four hours Montreal
had been written to, Gilly Foot had been written
to&mdash;and Andy was at the Nun's door.</p>

<p>She dwelt with Miss Dutton in a big block of
flats near Sloane Street, very high up. Her sitting-room
was small and cosy, presenting, however, one
marked peculiarity. On two of the walls the paper
was red, on the other two green. Seeing Andy's
eyes attracted by this phenomenon, the Nun explained:
"We quarrelled over the colour to such
an extent that at last I lost my temper, and, when
Sally was away for a day, had it done like this&mdash;to
spite her. Now she won't let me alter it, because
it's a perpetual warning to me not to lose my
temper. But it does look a little queer, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>She had received him with her usual composure.
"I knew you'd come, because I knew Mr. Jack
Rock would do as I wanted, and I was sure he
couldn't keep the letter to himself. Well, that's
all right! It was only that the obvious thing
wanted doing."</p>

<p>"But I don't see&mdash;well, I don't see why you
should care."</p>

<p>She looked at him, a lurking laugh in her eye.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_205" title="pg 205"></a>
"Oh, you needn't suppose that it was life and
death to me! It was rather fun, just on its own
account. You'll like Gilly; he's a good sort,
though he's rather greedy. Did you notice that?
Billy's really my friend. I'm very fond of Billy.
Are you ambitious? Billy's very ambitious."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I am."</p>

<p>The Nun lay back on a long chair; she was certainly
wonderfully pretty as she smiled lazily at
Andy.</p>

<p>"You look a size too large for the room," she
remarked. "Yes, Billy's ambitious. He'd like to
marry me, only he's ambitious. It doesn't make
any difference to me, because I'm not in love
with him; but I'm afraid it's an awfully uncomfortable
state of affairs for poor Billy."</p>

<p>"Well, if he'd have no chance anyhow, couldn't
you sort of let him know that?" Andy suggested,
much amused at an innocent malice which marked
her description of Billy's conflict of feeling.</p>

<p>"No use at all. I've tried. But he's quite sure
he could persuade me. In fact I don't think he
believes I should refuse if it came to the point.
So there he is, always just pulling up on the
brink! He can't like it, but he goes on. Oh,
but tell me all about Harry Belfield. Now I've
got you off" my mind, I'm awfully interested about
that."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_206" title="pg 206"></a>
Andy was not very ready at description. She
assisted him by a detailed and skilful cross-examination,
directed to eliciting full information about
Vivien Wellgood's appearance, habits, and character&mdash;how
old she was, where she had been, what
she had seen. When the picture of Vivien had
thus emerged&mdash;of Vivien's youth and secluded life,
how she had been nowhere and seen nothing, how
she was timid and shy, innocent and trustful, above
all, how she idolized Harry&mdash;the Nun considered
it for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" she said at last. Andy looked
sharply at her. She smiled. "Oh yes, you
worship Harry, don't you? Well, he's a very
charming man. I was rather inclined to fall in
love with him once myself. Luckily for me I
didn't."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'd have responded," Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it; he would have! When
did you say they were going to be married?"</p>

<p>"October, I think Harry said."</p>

<p>"Four months! And he dotes on her?"</p>

<p>"I should think so. You should just hear
him!"</p>

<p>"I daresay I shall. He always likes talking
to one girl about how much he's in love with
another."</p>

<p>The Nun's matter-of-fact way of speaking may
<a class="pagenum" id="page_207" title="pg 207"></a>
have contributed to the effect, but in the end the
effect of what she said was to give the impression
that she regarded Harry Belfield's present passion
as one of a series&mdash;far from the first, not at all
likely to be the last. The inflection of tone with
which she had exclaimed "Four months!" implied
that it was a very long while to wait.</p>

<p>"You'd understand it better if you saw them
together," said Andy, eager, as always, to champion
his friend.</p>

<p>"You're very enthusiastic about her, anyhow,"
smiled the Nun. "It almost sounds as if you
were a little in love with her yourself."</p>

<p>"Such a thing never occurred to me." Then
he laughed, for the Nun was laughing at him.
"Well, she would make every man want to&mdash;well,
sort of want to take care of her, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm in your doing that&mdash;in
moderation; and she may come to want it. Have
you ever been in love yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once," he confessed; "a long while ago,
just before I left South Africa."</p>

<p>"Got over it?" she inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I have, long ago. It wasn't
very fatal."</p>

<p>"Fickle creature!"</p>

<p>Andy gave one of his bursts of hearty laughter
to hear himself thus described.</p>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_208" title="pg 208"></a>"I like you," she said; "and I'm glad you're
going in with Gilly, because we shall often see you
at lunch-time."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't afford to lunch at that place
every day!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to&mdash;with Gilly; because lunch is
the only time he ever gets ideas&mdash;he always says
so&mdash;and unless he can tell somebody else he forgets
them again, and they're lost beyond recall.
He used to tell them to me, but I always forgot
them too. Now he'll tell you; so you'll have
to be at lunch, and put it down as office expenses."</p>

<p>Andy had risen to go. The Nun sat up. "I
can only tell you once again how grateful I am for
all your kindness," he said.</p>

<p>She gave him a whimsically humorous look.
"It's really time somebody told you," she said;
"and as I feel rather responsible for you, after my
letter to Mr. Jack Rock, I expect I'm the proper
person to do it. If you're not told, you may
go about doing a lot of mischief without knowing
anything about it. Prepare for a surprise.
You're attractive! Yes, you are. You're attractive
to women, moreover. People don't do things
for you out of mere kindness, as they might be
kind to a little boy in the street or to a lost
dog. They do them because you're attractive,
because it gives them pleasure to please you.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_209" title="pg 209"></a>
That sort of thing will go on happening to you;
very likely it'll help you a good deal." She
nodded at him wisely, then broke suddenly into
her gurgle. "Oh, dear me, you do look so much
astonished, and if you only knew how red you've
got!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I feel the redness all right; I know that's
there," muttered Andy, whose confusion was indeed
lamentable. "But when a&mdash;a person like
you says that sort of thing to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A person, like me?" She lifted her brows.
"What am I? I'm the fashion for three or four
seasons&mdash;that's what I am. Nobody knows where
I come from; nobody knows where I'm going to;
and nobody cares. I don't know myself, and I'm
not sure I care. My small opinion doesn't count
for much. Only, in this case, it happens to be
true."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked Andy, in
a sudden impulse of great friendliness.</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the face. "Nobody
knows. Nobody must ask."</p>

<p>"I've got no people belonging to me either.
Even Jack Rock's no relation&mdash;or only a 'step.'"</p>

<p>Her eyes grew a little clouded. "You mustn't
make me silly. Only we're friends now, aren't
we? We don't do what we can for one another
out of kindness, but for love?" She daintily blew
<a class="pagenum" id="page_210" title="pg 210"></a>
him a kiss, and smiled again. "And because
we're both very attractive&mdash;aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll accept the word if I'm promoted to
share it with you. But I can't say I've got over
the surprise yet."</p>

<p>"You've stopped blushing, anyhow. That's
something. Good-bye. I shall see you at lunch,
I expect, to-morrow."</p>

<p>Andy was very glad that she liked him, but he
was glad of it because he liked her. His head was
not turned by her assurance that he was attractive
in a general sense: in the first place, because he
remained distinctly sceptical as to the correctness
of her opinion, sincere as it obviously was; in the
second, because the matter did not appear to be
one of much moment. No doubt folks sometimes
did one a good turn for love's sake, but, taking
the world broadly, a man had to make his way
without relying on such help as that. That sort
of help had given him a fair start now. He was
not going to expect any more of it. It seemed
to him that Jack Rock&mdash;or Jack and the Nun
between them?&mdash;had already given him more than
his share. It was curious to associate her with
Jack Rock in the work; a queer freak of chance
that she had come into it! But she had come into
it&mdash;by chance and her own wilful fancy. Odd her
share in it certainly was, but it was not unpleasant
<a class="pagenum" id="page_211" title="pg 211"></a>
to him. He felt that he had gained a friend, as
well as an opening in Gilly Foot's publishing
house.</p>

<p>"But I wish," he found himself reflecting as he
travelled back in the Underground, "that she
understood Harry better."</p>

<p>Here he fell into an error unusual with him;
he overrated his own judgment, led thereto by old
love and admiration. The Nun had clear eyes;
she had seen much of Harry Belfield, and no small
amount of life. She had had to dodge many
dangers. She knew what she was talking about.
In all the side of things she knew so well, Andy,
with his one attachment before he left South Africa
long ago, was an innocent. Perhaps it was some
dim consciousness of this, some half-realized feeling
that he was on strange ground where she was on
familiar, which made him find it difficult to get
what she had said or hinted out of his head. It
was apt to come back to him when he saw Vivien
Wellgood; an unlooked-for association in his
mind of people who seemed far remote from one
another. Thus the Nun had come into the old
circle of his thoughts; henceforward she too belonged,
in a way, to the world of Meriton.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI.<a class="pagenum" id="page_212" title="pg 212"></a></h2>

<h2>THE SHAWL BY THE WINDOW.</h2>

<p>Vivien and Isobel were alone at Nutley. It
had been Wellgood's custom to go every
summer to Norway by himself, leaving his daughter
at school, to the care of her governess, or, for the
last year or two, of her companion. He saw no
reason against following his practice this year;
indeed he was glad to go. The interval before
the wedding dragged for him, as perhaps it did
for others. He had carried matters with Isobel
as far as he well could, unless he meant to carry
them to the end&mdash;and it was not his intention
to do that just yet. A last bachelor excursion&mdash;he
told himself confidently that it was to be his
last&mdash;had its attraction. Early in July he packed
his portmanteau and went, leaving instructions
with Isobel that her chaperonage was to be vigilant
and strict. "Err on the safe side," he said. "No
harm in that."</p>

<p>"I shall bore them very much," Isobel suggested.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_213" title="pg 213"></a>
"That's what you're here for." He added,
with his hard confident smile, "Later on we'll
try to give you a change from it."</p>

<p>She knew well what he meant, and was glad
to see the last of him for a while; nay, in her
heart would have been glad to see the last of him
for ever. She clung to what his words and acts
promised, from no affection for him, but because
it saved her from the common fate which her pride
despised&mdash;being dismissed, turned off, now that
she was to become superfluous. She had been
in effect Vivien's governess, her schoolmistress,
invested with power and authority. She hated to
step down; it was open to her to step up. (A
case not unlike Andy's.) Here was the secret
which maintained her pride. In the strength of
it she still ruled her charge with no lessening of
prestige. It was no more in Vivien's nature than
in her position to wonder at that; her eyes were
set on a near sure liberty. Temporary restraint,
though it might be irksome, seemed no more than
a natural passing incident. Harry noticed and was
amused. He thought that Wellgood must have
said a word to Isobel; hinted perhaps that Vivien
was wax in her lover's hands, and that her lover
was impetuous. That Wellgood, or Isobel herself,
or anybody else, should harbour that idea
did not displease Harry Belfield; not to be able
<a class="pagenum" id="page_214" title="pg 214"></a>
to resist him would be a venial sin, even in
Vivien.</p>

<p>It was an empty season in the little circle of
Meriton society. Harry's father and mother were
away, gone to Switzerland. Andy came down for
week-ends generally; all the working days his nose
was close to the grindstone in the office of Messrs.
Gilbert Foot and Co. He was learning the business,
delighting in his new activity. Harry would
not have been in Meriton either, had he not been
in love in Meriton. As it was, he had his early
ride, then read his books, then went over to Nutley
for lunch, and spent all the rest of the day there.
Often the curate would come in and make a four
at tennis, but he did not stay to dinner. Almost
every evening the three were alone, in the house
or on the terrace by the water. One night in the
week Harry might be in town, one night perhaps
he would bring Andy. Four or five nights those
three would be together; and the question for
Isobel was how often, for how long, how completely
she was to leave the engaged couple to
themselves. To put it more brutally&mdash;how much
of a bore was she to make herself?</p>

<p>To be a spy, a hindrance, a clog, to know that
joy waited on the closing of the door behind her
back, to listen to allusions half-intelligible, to turn
a blind ear to words too tender, not to notice a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_215" title="pg 215"></a>
furtive caress, to play the dragon of convention,
the old-maid duenna&mdash;that was her function in
Vivien's eyes. And the same in Harry's? Oh
yes! the same in Harry Belfield's handsome,
mischievous, deriding eyes! He laughed at her
for what she did&mdash;for what she did in the discharge
of her duty, earning her bread-and-butter.
Earning more than he thought, though! Because
of the derision in Harry's eyes, again she would
not let Wellgood go. Vivien should awake to
realize that she was more than a chaperon, tiresome
for the moment, soon to be dismissed;
Harry should understand that to one man she
was no old-maid duenna, but the woman he
wanted for wife. While she played chaperon at
Nutley she wrote letters to Wellgood&mdash;letters
keeping his passion alive, playing with his confidence,
transparently feigning to ignore, hardly
pretending to deny. They were letters a lover
successful in the end would laugh at. If in the
issue the man found himself jockeyed, they would
furnish matter for fury as a great deceit.</p>

<p>Harry Belfield was still looking forward to his
marriage with ardour; it would not be fair even
to say that he was getting tired of his engagement.
But he would have been wise to imitate Wellgood&mdash;take
a last bachelor holiday, and so come back
again hungry for Vivien's society. Much as he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_216" title="pg 216"></a>
liked the fare, he could not be said to hunger for
it now, it came to him so easily and so constantly.
The absence of his parents, the emptiness of the
town, his own want of anything particular to do,
prevented even the small hindrances and interruptions
that might have whetted appetite by
thwarting or delaying its satisfaction. Love-making
became the business of his days, when it
ought to have been the diversion. Harry must
always have a diversion&mdash;by preference one with
something of audacity, venture, or breaking of
bounds in it. His relations with Vivien, legitimate
though romantic, secure yet delightful, did not
satisfy this requirement. His career might have
served, and would serve in the future (so it was
to be hoped), but the career was at a temporary
halt till the autumn campaign began. He took
the diversion which lay nearest to hand; that also
was his way. Isobel Vintry possessed attractions;
she had a temper too, as he knew very well. He
found his amusement in teasing, chaffing, and
challenging her, in forcing her to play duenna
more and more conspicuously, and in laughing at
her when she did it; in letting his handsome eyes
rest on her in admiration for a second before he
hastily turned them back to a renewed contemplation
of  their proper shrine; in seeming half-vexed
when she left him alone with Vivien, not altogether
<a class="pagenum" id="page_217" title="pg 217"></a>
sorry when she came back. He was up to a dozen
such tricks; they were his diversion; they flavoured
the sweetness of his love-making with the spice of
mischief.</p>

<p>He saw that Isobel felt, that she understood.
Vivien noticed nothing, understood nothing.
There was a secret set up between Isobel and
himself; Vivien was a stranger to it. Harry
enlarged his interests! His relations with Vivien
were delightful, with Isobel they had a piquant
flavour. Well, was not this a more agreeable
state of things than that Isobel should be simply
a bore to him, and he simply a bore to Isobel?
The fact of being an engaged man did not
reconcile Harry Belfield to being simply a bore
to a handsome woman.</p>

<p>Among Wellgood's orders there was one that
Vivien should go to bed at ten o'clock sharp, and
Harry depart at the same hour. Wherever they
were, in house or garden, the lovers had to be
found and parted&mdash;Vivien ordered upstairs, Harry
sent about his business. Isobel's duty was to
enforce this rule. Harry found a handle in it;
his malice laid hold of it.</p>

<p>"Here comes the strict governess!" he cried.
Or, "Here's nurse! Bedtime! Won't you really
let us have ten minutes more? I believe you sit
with your watch in your hand."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_218" title="pg 218"></a>
Vivien rebuked him. "It's not poor Isobel's
fault, Harry. She's got to."</p>

<p>"No, she likes doing it. She's a born martinet!
She positively loves to separate us. You've no
sympathy with the soft emotions, Miss Vintry.
You're just a born dragon."</p>

<p>"Please come, Vivien," Isobel said, flushing
a little. "It's not my fault, you know."</p>

<p>"Do you never break rules, Miss Vintry? It's
what they're made for, you know."</p>

<p>"We've not been taught to think that in this
house, have we, Vivien?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Vivien with marked emphasis.</p>

<p>Harry laughed. "A pattern child and a pattern
governess! Well, we must kiss good-night. You
and I, I mean, of course, Vivien. And I'm sent
home too, as usual?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to stay here alone, do you?"
asked Isobel.</p>

<p>"Well, no, that wouldn't be very lively." His
eyes rested on her a moment, possibly&mdash;just possibly&mdash;hinting
that, though Vivien left him, yet
he need not be alone.</p>

<p>One evening, a very fine one&mdash;when it seemed
more absurd than usual to be ordered to bed or to
be sent home so early&mdash;Harry chaffed Isobel in
this fashion, yet with a touch of real contempt.
He did feel a genuine contempt for people who
<a class="pagenum" id="page_219" title="pg 219"></a>
kept rules just because they were rules. Vivien
again interceded. "Isobel can't help it, Harry.
It's father's orders."</p>

<p>"Surely some discretion is left to the trusty
guardian?"</p>

<p>"It's no pleasure to me to be a nuisance, I
assure you," said Isobel rather hotly. "Please
come in, Vivien; it's well past ten o'clock."</p>

<p>Vivien rose directly.</p>

<p>"You've hurt Isobel, I think," she whispered to
Harry. "Say something kind to her. Good-night,
dear Harry!"</p>

<p>She ran off, ahead of Isobel, who was about to
follow, with no word to Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a minute, please, Miss Vintry! I
say, you know, I was only joking. Of course I
know it's not your fault. I'm awfully sorry if I
sounded rude. I thought you wouldn't mind a bit
of chaff."</p>

<p>She stood looking at him with a hostile air.</p>

<p>"Why does it amuse you?" she asked.</p>

<p>The square question puzzled Harry, but he was
apt at an encounter. He found a good answer.
"I suppose because what you do&mdash;what you
have to do&mdash;seems somehow so incongruous, coming
from you. I won't do it again, if you don't
like it. Please forgive me&mdash;and walk with me to the
gate to prove it. There's no rule against that!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_220" title="pg 220"></a>
For half a minute she stood, still looking at him.
The moonlight was amply bright enough to let
them see one another's faces.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "Come along."</p>

<p>Harry followed her with a pleasant feeling of
curiosity. It was some little while before she spoke
again. They had already reached the drive.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that it's incongruous, coming
from me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't answer that without being
impertinent again," laughed Harry.</p>

<p>She turned to him with a slight smile. "Risk
that!"</p>

<p>It was many days since he had been alone with
her&mdash;so devoted had he been to Vivien. Now
again he felt her power; again he did not know
whether she put it forth consciously.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you playing sheep-dog when you
ought to be&mdash;" He broke off, leaving his eyes to
finish for him.</p>

<p>"So your teasing is to be considered as a
compliment?"</p>

<p>"I'll go on with it, if you'll take it like that."</p>

<p>"Does Vivien take it like that, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe she thinks anything about it&mdash;one
way or the other. She's partial to my small
efforts to be amusing, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's a compliment, I don't want any
<a class="pagenum" id="page_221" title="pg 221"></a>
more of it. I think you'd better, under the circumstances,
keep all your compliments for Vivien&mdash;till
you're married, at all events!"</p>

<p>Harry lifted his brows.</p>

<p>"Rules! Oh, those rules!" he said with mock
ruefulness.</p>

<p>"Is there any good in breaking them&mdash;for
nothing?"</p>

<p>He turned quickly towards her. She was smiling
at him. "For nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Here we are at the gate. Good-night,
Mr. Harry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I really can't stay any longer." She was doing
the mockery now; his eagerness had given her the
advantage. "You can think over my meaning&mdash;if
you like. Good-night!"</p>

<p>Harry said good-night. When he had gone
fifty yards he looked back. She was still there,
holding the gate half open with her hand, looking
along the road. After him? As he went on, his
thoughts were not all of Vivien. Isobel Vintry
was a puzzling girl!</p>

<p>The next evening he brought Vivien into the
drawing-room punctually at ten.</p>

<p>"We're good children to-night!" he said gaily.
"We've even said good-night to one another
already, and Vivien's ready to run up to bed."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_222" title="pg 222"></a>
"There, Isobel, aren't we good?" cried Vivien,
with her good-night kiss to Isobel.</p>

<p>"Any reward?" asked Harry, as the door closed
behind his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>"What do you ask?"</p>

<p>"A walk to the gate. And&mdash;perhaps&mdash;an explanation."</p>

<p>"Certainly no explanation. I don't mind five
minutes' walk to the gate."</p>

<p>This time very little was said on the way to the
gate. A constraint seemed to fall on both of them.
The night felt very silent, very still; the lake
stretched silent and still too, mysteriously tranquil.</p>

<p>At last Harry spoke. "You've forgiven me&mdash;quite?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Naturally you didn't think how&mdash;how
it seemed to me. It isn't always easy to&mdash;"
She paused for a moment, looking over the water.
"But it's my place in life&mdash;for the present, at all
events."</p>

<p>"It won't be for long. It can't be." He laughed.
"But I must take care&mdash;compliments barred!"</p>

<p>"From you to me&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Again her words&mdash;or the way she said them&mdash;stirred
him to an eager curiosity. She half said
things, or said things with half-meanings. Was
that art or accident? She did not say "from an
engaged man to his <i>fianc&eacute;e's</i> companion," but "from
<a class="pagenum" id="page_223" title="pg 223"></a>
you to me." Was the concrete&mdash;the personal&mdash;form
significant?</p>

<p>No more passed, save only, at the gate, "Good-night."
But with the word she gave him her hand
and smiled at him&mdash;and ever so slightly shook her
head.</p>

<p>The next day, and the next, and the next, she
left Vivien and him entirely to themselves, save
when meals forced her to appear; and on none of
the three nights would she walk with him to the
gate, though he asked twice in words and the third
time with his eyes. Was that what the little shake
of her head had meant? But the two walks had
left their mark. Harry chaffed and teased no
more.</p>

<p>Vivien praised his forbearance, adding, "I really
think you hurt her feelings a little, Harry. But
it was being rather absurdly touchy, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"She seems to be sensitive about her position."</p>

<p>Vivien made a little grimace. She was thinking
that Isobel's position in the house had been at least
as pleasant as her own&mdash;till Harry came to woo.</p>

<p>"Oh, confound this political business!" Harry
suddenly broke out. "But for that we could get
married in the middle of August&mdash;as soon as your
father and my people are back. I hate this waiting
till October, don't you? Now you know you do,
Vivien!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_224" title="pg 224"></a>
She put her hand on his and pressed it gently.
"Yes, but it's pleasant as it is. I'm not so very
impatient&mdash;so long as I see you every day."</p>

<p>But Harry was impatient now, and rather restless.
The days had ceased to glide by so easily, almost
imperceptibly, in the company of his lover. There
was a feeling in him which did not make for peace&mdash;a
recrudescence of those impulses of old days
which his engagement was utterly to have banished.
Marriage was invoked to banish them utterly now.
The sooner marriage came, the better! Harry was
ardent in his love-making that afternoon, and Vivien
in a heaven of delight. If there was no chaff, there
was no appeal to Isobel for a walk to the gate
either.</p>

<p>"I wish she wasn't there," he said to himself
as he walked down, alone, to the gate at a punctual
ten o'clock. Somehow his delight in his love for
Vivien, and in hers for him, was being marred.
Ever so little, ever so faintly, yet still a little, his
romance was turning to duty. A delightful duty,
of course, one in which his whole heart was engaged,
but still no longer just the one thing&mdash;the
spontaneous voluntary thing&mdash;which filled his life.
It had now an opposite. Besides all else that it
was, it had also&mdash;even now, even before that marriage
so slow in coming&mdash;taken on the aspect of the
right thing. In the remote corners of his mind&mdash;banished
<a class="pagenum" id="page_225" title="pg 225"></a>
to those&mdash;hovered the shadowy image of
its opposite. Quite impossible that the image
should put on bones and flesh&mdash;should take life!
Yes, Harry was sure of that. But even its phantom
presence was disturbing.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd got rid of all that!" Some such
protest, yet even vaguer and less formulated, stirred
in his thoughts. He conceived that he had become
superior to temptation. Had he? For he was
objecting to being tempted. Who tempted him?
Did she&mdash;or only he himself, the man he was?
The question hung doubtful, and thereby pressed
him the closer. He flattered himself that he knew
women. What else had he to show for a good
deal of time&mdash;to say nothing of wear and tear of
the emotions? Here was a woman whose meaning,
whose feeling towards himself, he did not
know.</p>

<p>Andy Hayes was free the next afternoon&mdash;his
half-holiday. Harry picked him up at his lodgings
and carried him with him to Nutley. Harry was
glad to have him, glad to hear all about Gilbert
Foot and Co., even more glad to see his own
position through Andy's eyes. Andy's vision was
always so normal, so sane, so simple; his assumptions
were always so right. A man really had only
to live up to Andy's assumptions to be perfectly
right. He assumed that a man was honest, straight,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_226" title="pg 226"></a>
single-minded&mdash;unreservedly and exclusively in
love with the girl he was going to marry. Why,
of course a man was! Or why marry her? Even
foolishly in love with her? Rather spoonily, as
some might think? Andy, perhaps, went so far as
to assume that. Well, it was a most healthy
assumption&mdash;eminently right on the practical side;
primitive perhaps, but tremendously right.</p>

<p>"I'll take Miss Vintry off your hands. Don't
be afraid about that!" laughed Andy.</p>

<p>"I don't know that you'll be allowed to.
You're no end of a favourite of Vivien's. She
often talks about you. In fact I think I'm a bit
jealous, Andy!"</p>

<p>Andy's presence seemed to restore his balance,
which had seemed shaken&mdash;even if very slightly.
He found himself again dwelling on the charms of
Vivien, recalling her pretty ways and the shy
touches of humour that sometimes ornamented her
timidity.</p>

<p>"I asked her the other day&mdash;I was playing the
fool, you know&mdash;what she would do if I forsook
her. What do think she said?"</p>

<p>Andy was prepared for anything brilliant, but,
naturally, unable to suggest it.</p>

<p>"She said, 'Drown myself in the lake, Harry&mdash;or
else send for Andy Hayes.'"</p>

<p>"Did she say that?" cried Andy, hugely delighted,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_227" title="pg 227"></a>
blushing as red as he had when the Nun
told him that he was attractive.</p>

<p>If Andy's simplicity and ready enthusiasm were
congenial to some minds and some moods, to
others they could be very exasperating. To have
it assumed that you are feeling just what you
ought to feel&mdash;or even rather more than could in
strictness be expected from you&mdash;may be a strain
on your patience. Harry had welcomed in Andy
an assumption of this order; at the moment it
helped him. Isobel gave a similar assumption
about her feelings a much less hearty welcome.
While Harry and Vivien took a stroll by themselves
after lunch, Andy sat by her and was enthusiastic
about them; he had forgotten the Nun's
unjust hints.</p>

<p>Isobel chafed. "Oh, yes, it's all very ideal,
I daresay, Mr. Hayes. Let's hope it'll last!
But Mr. Harry's been in love before, hasn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Most people have had a fancy or two." (Even
he himself had indulged in one.) "This is quite
different to him, I know. And how could anybody
help being fond of her?"</p>

<p>"At any rate she's pretty free from the dangers
of competition down here." She looked at Andy
with a curious smile.</p>

<p>He laughed heartily. "Yes, that's all right,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_228" title="pg 228"></a>
anyhow! Not that it would make any difference,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>"If it were only to show this simpleton&mdash;"
The angry thought was in her heart. But there
was more. Harry's devotion was seeming very
whole-hearted that day. Had she lost her power
to disturb it? Was Andy in the end right in
leaving her utterly out of consideration? Every
day now and every hour it hurt her more to see
Harry's handsome head ever bowed to Vivien, his
eyes asking her love and receiving the loving
answer. A wave of jealousy and of defiance swept
over her. Andy need not know&mdash;she could afford
to leave him in his folly. Vivien must not know&mdash;that
would be too inconvenient. But Harry
himself&mdash;was he quite to forget those two walks
to the gate? She burned to use her power. A
letter from Wellgood had reached her that morning;
it was not a proposal of marriage, but by his
talk of future plans&mdash;of what was to happen after
Vivien left them&mdash;it assumed that she was still to
be at Nutley. The implication was definite;
matters only awaited his return.</p>

<p>"I haven't had a single word with you&mdash;by ourselves&mdash;all
day," said Vivien to Andy after dinner.
"You'll walk with me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"For my part I don't think I want to walk at
all," said Harry. "It's rather chilly. Will you
<a class="pagenum" id="page_229" title="pg 229"></a>
keep me company indoors, and forgive my cigar,
Miss Vintry?"</p>

<p>Isobel assented rather coldly, but her heart beat
quicker. Now that the chance came&mdash;by no contrivance
of hers and unexpectedly&mdash;she was
suddenly afraid of it, and afraid of what seemed
a sudden revelation of the strength of her feeling
for Harry. She had meant to play with him, to
show him that, if she was to be left out of the
reckoning, it was by her own choice; to make him
see her power fully for once before she hid it for
ever. Could she carry out her dangerous programme?
Harry had been at his gayest that
night, just in the mood which had carried him to
most of his conquests&mdash;gaily daring, skirting topics
of gallantry with defiant ease, provoking, yet
never offending. If his eyes spoke true, he was
in the mood still.</p>

<p>"Only a week more!" he said. "Then papa-in-law
comes back, and I go electioneering. Well,
I suppose we've had enough of what they call dalliance."
He sank into an armchair by the fireplace,
sighing in pleasant indolence, lolling gracefully.</p>

<p>The long windows were open to the terrace;
the evening air came in cool and sweet. She
looked out on the terrace; Vivien and Andy had
wandered away; they were not in sight. Vivien's
wrap lay on a chair close to the window.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_230" title="pg 230"></a>
"Vivien ought to have taken her wrap," said
Isobel absently, as she came back and stood by the
mantelpiece opposite Harry. Her cheeks were a
little flushed and her eyes bright to-night; she
responded to Harry's gaiety, his mood acted on
hers.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do after we're&mdash;after
the break-up here?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>She smiled down at him, pausing a moment
before she answered. "You seem quite sure that
there will be a complete break-up," she said.</p>

<p>He looked hard at her; she smiled steadily.
"Well, I know that Vivien won't be here," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that much too, Mr. Harry. But
I suppose her father will."</p>

<p>"I suppose that too. Which leaves only one
of the party unaccounted for."</p>

<p>"Yes, only one of us unaccounted for."</p>

<p>"One that may be Miss Wellgood's companion,
but could hardly be Mr. Wellgood's.
He can scarcely claim the privileges of old age
yet."</p>

<p>"You think I ought to be looking out for
another situation? But supposing&mdash;merely supposing&mdash;Mr.
Wellgood didn't agree?"</p>

<p>Harry flung his cigar into the grate. "Do you
mean&mdash;?" he said slowly. She gave a little laugh.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_231" title="pg 231"></a>
He laughed too, rather uneasily. "I say, you
can't mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Can't I? Well, I only said 'supposing.'
And I think you chaffed me about it yourself once.
You forget what you say to women, Mr. Harry."</p>

<p>"Should you like it?"</p>

<p>"Beggars mustn't be choosers. We can't all be
as lucky as Vivien!"</p>

<p>"Was I serious? No&mdash;I mean&mdash;are you?
Wellgood!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be? Or why shouldn't Mr.
Wellgood? It seems absurd?"</p>

<p>"Not in Wellgood, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Beggars mustn't be choosers."</p>

<p>"You a beggar! Why, you're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What am I?"</p>

<p>"Shall I break the rules?"</p>

<p>She gave him a long look before answering.
"No, don't." Her voice shook a little, her composure
was less perfect.</p>

<p>Harry was no novice; the break in the voice
did not escape him. He marked it with a thrill
of triumph; it told him that she was not merely
playing with him; he was holding his own, he had
his power. The fight was equal. He rose to his
feet and stood facing her, both of them by the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to say anything about this to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_232" title="pg 232"></a>
Vivien, because it's not definite yet. If the opportunity
were offered to me, don't you think I
should be wise to accept?"</p>

<p>"Are you in love with him?" He looked in
her eyes. "No, you can't be!"</p>

<p>"Your standard of romance is so high. I like
him&mdash;and perhaps I don't like looking out for
another situation." Her tone was lighter; she
seemed mistress of herself again. But Harry had
not forgotten the break in her voice.</p>

<p>"Have you considered that this arrangement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which we have supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would make you my mother-in-law?"</p>

<p>"Well, your stepmother-in-law. That doesn't
sound quite so oppressive, I hope?"</p>

<p>"They both sound to me considerably absurd."</p>

<p>"I really can't see why they should."</p>

<p>Their eyes met in confidence, mirthful and
defiant. They fought their duel now, forgetful
of everybody except themselves. His old spirit
had seized on Harry; it carried him away. She
gave herself up to the delight of her triumph
and to the pleasure that his challenge gave
her. Out of sight, out of mind, were Vivien and
Andy.</p>

<p>"But relationship has its consolations, its privileges,"
said Harry, leaning towards her, his face
alight with mischievous merriment. He offered
<a class="pagenum" id="page_233" title="pg 233"></a>
her his hand. "At all events, accept my congratulations."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. "You're premature,
both with congratulations and with relationship."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm always in a hurry about things,"
laughed Harry, holding her hand. He leant
closer yet; his face was very near hers now&mdash;his
comely face with its laughing luring eyes. She
did not retreat. Harry saw in her eyes, in her
flushed cheeks and quickened breath, in her
motionlessness, the permission that he sought.
Bending, he kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh, triumphant, yet deprecatory
and nervous. Her face was all aflame.
Harry's gaze was on her; slowly he released her
hand. She stood an instant longer, then, with a
shrug of her shoulders, walked across the room
towards the windows. Harry stood watching her,
exultant and merry still.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came to a stand. She spoke
without looking round. "Vivien's shawl was on
that chair."</p>

<p>The words hardly reached his preoccupied brain.
"What? Whose shawl?"</p>

<p>She turned round slowly. "Vivien's shawl was
on that chair, and it's gone," she said.</p>

<p>Harry darted past her to the window, and
looked out. He came back to her on tiptoe and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_234" title="pg 234"></a>
whispered, "Andy! He's about two-thirds of
the way across the terrace with the thing now."</p>

<p>"He must have come in just a moment ago,"
she whispered in return.</p>

<p>Harry nodded. "Yes&mdash;just a moment ago.
I wonder&mdash;!" He pursed up his lips, but still
there was a laughing devil in his eye. "Lucky
she didn't come for it herself!" he said. "But&mdash;well,
I wonder!"</p>

<p>She laid her finger on her lips. They heard
steps approaching, and Vivien's merry voice.
Harry made a queer, half-puzzled, half-amused
grimace. Isobel walked quickly on to the terrace.
Inside the light fell too mercilessly on her cheeks;
she would meet them beneath the friendly cover
of the night.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_235" title="pg 235"></a></h2>

<h2>CONCERNING A STOLEN KISS.</h2>

<p>A stolen kiss may mean very different things&mdash;almost
nothing (not quite nothing, or why
steal it?), something yet not too much, or well-nigh
everything. The two parties need not give
it the same value; a witness of it is not, of necessity,
bound by the valuation of either of them. It may
be merely a jest, of such taste as charity can allow
in the circumstances; it may be the crown and end
of a slight and passing flirtation; it may be the
first visible mark of a passion destined to grow
to fierce intensity. Or it may seem utterly evasive
in its significance at the moment, as it were indecipherable
and imponderable, waiting to receive
from the future its meaning and its weight.</p>

<p>The last man to find his way through a maze
of emotional analysis was Andy Hayes; his mind
held no thread of experience whereby to track the
path, his temperament no instinct to divine it.
He could not assign a value&mdash;or values&mdash;to the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_236" title="pg 236"></a>
incident of which chance had made him a witness;
what Harry's impulse, Isobel's obvious acceptance
of it, the intensity and absorption that marked the
bearing of the two in the brief moment in which
he saw them as he lifted Vivien's shawl, stood
looking for a flash of time, and quickly turned
away&mdash;what these things meant or amounted to
he could not tell. But there was no uncertainty
about his feelings; he was filled with deep distaste.
He was not a man of impracticable ideals&mdash;his
mind walked always in the mean&mdash;but he was
naturally averse from intrigue, from underhand
doings, from the playing of double parts. They
were traitors in this thing; let it mean the least
it could, even to mere levity or unbecoming
jocularity (their faces rose in his mind to contradict
this view even as he put it), still they were so far
traitors. The first brunt of his censure fell on
Isobel, but his allegiance to Harry was also so
sorely shaken that it seemed as though it could
never be the same again. The engagement had
been to Andy a sacrosanct thing; it was now
sacrilegiously defaced by the hands of the two
most bound to guard it. "Very low-down!" was
Andy's humble phrase of condemnation&mdash;at least
very low-down; how much more he knew not
but that in the best view of the case. At the
moment his heart had gone out to Vivien in a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_237" title="pg 237"></a>
great pang of compassion; it seemed such a shame
to tamper with, even if not actually to betray, a
trust like hers. His face, like Isobel's, had been
red&mdash;but red with anger&mdash;under the cover of the
night. He was echoing the Nun's "Poor girl!"
which in loyalty to his friend he had before
resented.</p>

<p>His first impulse had been to shield Vivien
from any suspicion; it taught him a new cunning,
an hypocrisy not his own. If Isobel delayed their
return to the brightly lighted room, he did not
hurry it&mdash;let all the faces have time to recover!
But his voice was calm and unmoved; for him
he was even talkative and exuberant. When they
went in, he met Harry with an unembarrassed air.
Relief rose in Isobel; yet Harry doubted. So far
as Harry could reason, he must have all but seen,
probably had actually seen. And in one thing
there was significance. He went on devoting
himself to Vivien; he did not efface himself in
Harry's favour, as his wont was. He seemed to
make his presence a fence round her, forbidding
her lover's approach. Harry, now talking trifles
to Isobel, watched him keenly, hardly doubting,
hardly venturing to hope.</p>

<p>"Till lunch to-morrow, Harry," said Vivien
gaily, when the time for good-night came. "You'll
come too, won't you, Mr. Hayes?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_238" title="pg 238"></a>
"Thanks awfully, but I'm off for a big tramp."</p>

<p>"To dinner then?" asked Isobel very graciously.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, but I&mdash;I really must sup with
old Jack."</p>

<p>The quickest glance ran from Harry to Isobel.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Take the chance&mdash;the
bare chance&mdash;that he had not seen anything, or not
seen all? Or confess the indiscretion and plead
its triviality&mdash;with a vow of penitence, serious if
Andy must be serious over such a trifle, light if he
proved man of the world enough to join in laughing
it off? No, Harry would take the chance, poor
as it was. Even if Andy had seen, how could he
interfere? To confess, however lightly, would be
to give him a standing in the case, a right to put
his oar in. It would be silly to do that; as
matters stood now, his title could be denied if he
sought to meddle. He knew Andy well enough
to be sure that he would do nothing against him
without fair warning. If he meant to tell tales to
Vivien or to Wellgood, he would warn Harry first.
Time enough to wrestle with him then! Meanwhile
they&mdash;he was coupling Isobel with himself&mdash;would
stand on the defensive; nothing should be
admitted, everything should be ignored.</p>

<p>So much for Andy! He was assessed&mdash;a
possible danger, a certain cause for vigilance, also,
it must be confessed, rather an uncomfortable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_239" title="pg 239"></a>
presence, an embarrassing witness of his friend's
orthodox love-making, as he had been an unwilling
one of his heterodox. Meanwhile Harry's tact
was equal to the walk back to Meriton, Andy
proving inclined to silence but not unfriendly or
morose, still less actively aggressive or reproachful.
And he would not be at Meriton to-morrow. The
word could be passed to Isobel&mdash;be careful but say
nothing! Very careful in Andy's presence&mdash;but
no admissions to be made!</p>

<p>Aye, so much for Andy! But besides the
witness there are the parties. Besides the person
who catches you kissing, there is the person you
kiss. There is also you, who kiss. All questions
of value are not decided by the impression you
chance to make on the witness. The bystander
may see most of the game; the players settle the
stakes.</p>

<p>"Perverse!" was Harry's verdict on the whole
affair, given from his own point of view; not only
perverse that he should have been caught&mdash;if he
had been&mdash;but no less perverse that he should
have done the thing, that he should have wanted
to do it, and that he should feel as he now did
about it. Perhaps the last element was really the
most perverse of all, because it set up in his mind
an opposition to what was plainly the only course
open to him from Isobel's point of view. (Here
<a class="pagenum" id="page_240" title="pg 240"></a>
the question of the third value came in.) That
was surely open and avowed penitence&mdash;a sincere
apology, as serious or as light as was demanded or
would be accepted. She could not pretend that
she felt outraged. In truth they had shared in the
indiscretion and been partners in the peccadillo.
An apology not too abject, a hint at the temptation,
gracefully put, to serve for excuse, a return to the
safe ground of friendship&mdash;and a total oblivion of
the incident! Or, if they must think of it at all,
it would be without words&mdash;with a smile, maybe,
in a few days' time; that is how we feel about
some not serious, by no means unpleasant, little
scrape that is well over. Harry had been in a
good many such&mdash;perverse but not fatal, annoying
at the time, not necessarily things on which the
memory dwelt with pain in after days; far from it
sometimes, in fact.</p>

<p>That was the right thing to do, and the right
way to regard the episode. But Harry was conscious
of a complication&mdash;in the circumstances and
in his own feelings. Owing to his engagement
with Vivien he must go on frequenting Isobel's
society; owing to the memory of his kiss the
necessity was not distasteful. Well, these little
complications must be unravelled; the first
difficulty faced, the second ignored or overcome. He
arrived at so clear, sound, and prudent a resolution
<a class="pagenum" id="page_241" title="pg 241"></a>
thus to minimise the effects of his indiscretion that
he felt almost more virtuous than if he had been
discreet.</p>

<p>So the parties, as well as the witness, were
assessed. But who had put into his hand the
standard whereby to assess Isobel? She might
measure by another rule.</p>

<p>The confession&mdash;and absolution&mdash;thus virtuously
and comfortably planned did not take place the
next day, for the simple reason that Miss Vintry
afforded no opportunity for them; she was ill and
invisible. On the following day she was on a sofa.
Immediately on his appearance, Harry was sent
home again, Vivien declaring that she must be in
unremitting attendance on her friend. The third
day matters seemed back on their usual footing;
but still he got no private word with Isobel. Once
or twice he caught her looking at him in what
seemed a thoughtful way; when observed, she
averted her glance, but without embarrassment.
Perhaps this avoidance of all chance of private talk&mdash;of
all possibility of referring to the incident&mdash;was
her way of treating it; perhaps she meant to
dispense with apology and go straight to oblivion.
If that were her intention, she misjudged Harry's
feelings. He felt baulked of his scheme of confession
and absolution&mdash;baulked and tantalized.
He felt almost insulted&mdash;did she not think him
<a class="pagenum" id="page_242" title="pg 242"></a>
gentleman enough to apologise? He felt curious&mdash;did
she not feel the desire for an apology herself?
He felt amazed&mdash;had she no anxiety about Andy?
The net result was that he could think of little
else than of her and of the incident. And under
these circumstances he had to carry on his orthodox
love-making! The way of trangressors is said to be
hard; at moments Harry felt his worse than that;
it had a tendency to become ridiculous.</p>

<p>Against this abhorred peril he struck back
vigorously and instinctively on effective lines. He
could hold his own in a duel of the sexes. His
court of Vivien not only seemed but became more
ardent&mdash;in these matters the distinction between
being and seeming runs very thin, since the acting
excites the reality. If one woman teased him,
occupying his thoughts without satisfying his desire,
he turned to the adoration of another, and gave
her of his own that hers might be more complete.
Adoring Vivien found herself adored; Harry's
worship would break out even in Isobel's presence!
He who had been rather too content to accept now
asked; she could not do enough to witness her
love. Half-unconsciously fighting for a victory he
less than consciously desired, he struck at Isobel
through Vivien&mdash;and made Vivien supremely
happy. Happiness gave her confidence; confidence
gave her new charm, a new vivacity, a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_243" title="pg 243"></a>
daring to speak her gay and loving thoughts.
Who should not listen if Harry loved to hear?
Her growth in power to allure made Harry
wonder that he could not love single-heartedly,
why his recollection of the incident remained so
fresh and so ever-present. If Isobel would give
him a chance to wind it up! It was troublesome
now only because it hung in a mystery created by
her silence, because the memory of it was irritated
by a curiosity which her evasion of him maintained.
Did she think it nothing? Or could she not bear
to speak of it, because it was so much more? At
any rate she should see how he loved Vivien!</p>

<p>The three had this week to themselves&mdash;Andy
engulfed in town and Gilbert Foot and Co.,
Wellgood not due back till the Saturday. So
they passed it&mdash;Vivien in a new ecstasy; Harry
ardent, troubled, wondering; Isobel apart, thoughtful,
impossible to read. Thus they came to the
Friday. To-morrow Wellgood would be back.
Harry, thinking on this, thought suddenly of what
had led up to the incident&mdash;what had been the
excuse, the avenue, for his venture. It had been
absorbed in the incident itself. Wellgood's coming
gave it back to independent life. If what Isobel
had said were true, another lover entered on the
scene&mdash;Isobel's!</p>

<p>That night&mdash;when Harry had gone&mdash;Vivien
<a class="pagenum" id="page_244" title="pg 244"></a>
came to Isobel and kissed her, saying, "It's
wonderful, but to-night I'm sure!"</p>

<p>Isobel was looking at an illustrated paper. She
let her hand rest in Vivien's, but she did not raise
her eyes from the pictures. "Silly child, you've
been sure all along!"</p>

<p>"Not as I am to-night. I've been sure I pleased
him, that he liked me, that he liked my love. I've
never been sure that he really wanted it till the last
two or three days." She paused a moment, and
added softly, "Never sure he must have it, as
much as I must have his!"</p>

<p>Isobel's paper slipped from her knees on to the
floor, but still she did not look at Vivien.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful feeling that," the girl went
on; "to feel he must have it&mdash;that he must
have my love as I must have his. Before he
seemed to be doing all the giving&mdash;and I could
hardly believe! Now I'm giving too&mdash;we're
sharing. Somehow it makes a woman of me."
She playfully caressed Isobel's hand, running
fingers lightly over fingers. "I don't believe
I'm afraid even of you any more!" Her tone
was gay, affectionately bantering.</p>

<p>Now Isobel looked up at her as she leant over
her shoulder. "It makes you look very pretty."</p>

<p>"It makes me feel prettier still," laughed
Vivien. She put her face close to her friend's and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_245" title="pg 245"></a>
whispered, blushing, "He kisses me differently
now."</p>

<p>Isobel Vintry sharply drew her hand away.
Vivien's blush grew painfully bright.</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I oughtn't to have said that. You're
right, Isobel. It's&mdash;it's too sacred. But I was so
happy in it. Do forgive me, dear. I've got no
mother to talk to, Isobel. Not even a sister! I
know what you felt, but you must forgive me."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive, child. I meant
nothing when I took my hand away. I was going
to pick up the paper."</p>

<p>"Then kiss me, Isobel."</p>

<p>Isobel slowly turned her head and kissed the
girl's cheek. "I know what you mean, Vivien,"
she said with a smile that to the girl seemed
wistful, almost bitter.</p>

<p>"You dear!" she whispered. "Some day you
must be very happy too." Her voice carolled in
song as she sped upstairs.</p>

<p>"The good which I would I do not: but the
evil which I would not, that I do." That&mdash;and
possibly one other&mdash;reminiscence of the Scriptures
came back to Isobel Vintry when, with a kiss, she
had dismissed Vivien to her happy rest. There
was another law, warring against the law of her
mind&mdash;the law of the Restless and Savage Master.
He broke friendship's power and blurred the mirror
<a class="pagenum" id="page_246" title="pg 246"></a>
of loyalty. He drove her whither she would not
go, commanded her to set her hand to what she
would not touch, forced love to mate with loathing.
"The child is so beautifully happy," her spirit
cried. "Aye, in Harry Belfield's kisses," came
the Master's answer. "Wouldn't she be? You've
tasted them. You know." She knew. They
were different now! From those he had given
Vivien before? Yes. From the one he had
given her? Or like that one? Her jealousy
caught fresh flame from Vivien's shy revelation&mdash;fresh
flame and new shame. Harry was repenting&mdash;with
smiles of memory. She was sinning still,
with groans, with all her cunning, and with all
her might. Pass the theory that it is each man
for himself in this fight, and each woman for her
own hand. No doubt; but should not the fight
be fair? The girl did not so much as know there
was a fight, and should not and must not, unless
and until it had gone irrevocably against her.
"All's fair in love&mdash;and war." Yet traitors suffer
death from their own side and the enemy's contempt.</p>

<p>His kisses were different now&mdash;that set her
aflame. Aye, and to mark how under their new
charm Vivien opened into new power and took
hold on new weapons! The new kisses somehow
made a woman of her! It might be tolerable
to see him make his marriage of convenience,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_247" title="pg 247"></a>
doing no more than somewhat indolently allowing
himself to be adored. But to see him adoring
this other&mdash;that was to be worsted on the merits&mdash;not
merely to be impossible, but to be undesired.
Was that coming about? Had it come about&mdash;so
soon after the stolen kiss? Then the kiss had
been all failure, all shame; he had mocked while
he kissed. She was cheapened, yet not aided.
The cunning of the last six days had been bent
to prove that she had been aided&mdash;her value not
cheapened but enhanced.</p>

<p>Looking again out of the window whence she
had watched the pair at their love-making, looking
over the terrace, now empty, across the water (water
seems ever to answer to the onlooker's mood), she
exclaimed against the absence of safeguards. Were
she a wife&mdash;or were Vivien! That would be a
fence, making for protection&mdash;a sturdy fence, which
to break down or to leap over would be plain trespassing,
a profanation, open offence. Were she&mdash;or were
Vivien&mdash;a mother! The Savage Master himself
must own a worthy foe in motherhood&mdash;one that
gave him trouble, one that he vanquished only
after hard fighting, and then saw his victory
bitterly grudged, piteously wept over, deplored
in a heart-rending fashion; you could see that
in the morning's paper. She chanced to have
read such a case a day or two before. The letter
<a class="pagenum" id="page_248" title="pg 248"></a>
of confession was signed "Mother the outcast."
To have to sign like that&mdash;if you let the Master
beat you&mdash;was a deterrent, a safeguard, a shield.
Such defences she had not. Vivien was neither
wife nor mother; no more was she. The engagement
seemed but victory in the first bout; was
it forbidden to try the best of three? Nothing
was irrevocable yet&mdash;on either side. "At lovers'
vows&mdash;!" Or a stolen kiss! Or a stolen victory?</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered, and with the same
quality of smile as Vivien had marked, that she
had been an exemplary child, ever extolled, never
punished; a pattern schoolgirl, with the highest
marks, Queen on May-day (a throne not to be
achieved without the Principal's <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire!</i>), a
model student at Cambridge. Hence the unexceptionable
credentials which had introduced her
to Nutley, had made her Vivien's preceptress,
Vivien's bulwark against fear and weakness,
Vivien's shield&mdash;and destined to be a shield to
successive young ladies after Vivien. Who first
had undermined that accepted view of destiny,
had disordered that well-schooled, almost Sunday-schooled,
scheme of her life? Vivien's father,
who came back to-morrow. At whose challenge
was the shaken fortress like to fall? Vivien's
lover, who came yesterday and the day before,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_249" title="pg 249"></a>
to-morrow and the day after, every day till he
went out of life with Vivien.</p>

<p>As with minds greatly preoccupied, the ordinary
traffic of the hours passed unnoticed; bed, sleep,
breakfast, were a moment. She found herself
greeting Wellgood, newly arrived, ruddy and
robust, confident, self-satisfied&mdash;as she saw in a
moment, eager. His kiss to his daughter was
carelessly kind, and with it he let her go, she
not unwilling; Harry was due at the gate.
Wellgood's real greeting was for the woman
whom to see was his home-coming. He led
her with him into his study; he laid his hand
on her arm as he made her sit down near him.</p>

<p>"Well, have the lovers bored you to death with
their spooning since I've been away?"</p>

<p>"There's been a good deal of it, and not much
relief. Only Andy Hayes now and then."</p>

<p>"Rather tiresome to be the onlooker all the time.
Wouldn't you like a little on your own account?"</p>

<p>"I'm in no hurry." She looked him straight in
the face, rather defiantly.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind since I've been away.
I'm not a good hand at speeches or at spooning,
but I'm fond of you, Isobel. I'll make you a good
husband&mdash;and it's for you to consider whether you'll
ever get a better chance."</p>

<p>"I should like more time to think it over."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_250" title="pg 250"></a>
"Oh, come, don't tell me you haven't been
thinking it over for weeks past. What's the
difficulty?"</p>

<p>"I'm not in love with you&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"I don't expect to inspire a romantic passion,
like young Harry."</p>

<p>"Can't you leave Harry Belfield out of it?" she
asked irritably.</p>

<p>"I see he has bored you," chuckled Wellgood.
"But you like me? We get on together?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I like you, and we get on together. But
I don't want to marry yet."</p>

<p>"No more do I&mdash;just yet!" He rose and went
to the mantelpiece to choose a pipe. "Have you
got any friends you could stay a month with?"</p>

<p>His back was to her; he was busy filling the pipe.
He saw neither the sudden stiffening of her figure
nor the fear in her eyes. Was he going to send
her away&mdash;now? But she answered coolly, "Yes,
I think I could arrange it, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Somehow a man feels rather a fool, being
engaged himself while his girl's getting married.
We should have all the idiots in the neighbourhood
buzzing about with their jokes and congratulations.
I've made a plan to avoid all that.
We keep it quite dark till Vivien's wedding; then
you go off, ostensibly for good. I stay here and
give the place an overhauling; then I'll join you
<a class="pagenum" id="page_251" title="pg 251"></a>
in town, we'll be married there, and go for a jaunt.
By the time we come back they'll have cooled
down&mdash;and they'll be jolly glad to have shirked
their wedding presents." By now he had turned
round; the strain and the fear had passed from
Isobel; the month's visit to friends was not to come
now. "How do you like the scheme?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I like the scheme very much, and I'm all for
keeping it quiet till Vivien is disposed of."</p>

<p>He stood before her, smoking his pipe, his
hands in his pockets. "Shall we call it settled?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to call it settled yet."</p>

<p>He put down his pipe. "Look here, Isobel,
because I can't make pretty speeches, don't you
think I don't feel this thing. I want you, and
I want the thing settled. You ought to know
your mind by now. If you want to say no, you
can say it now, but I don't believe you do. Then
why can't you say yes? It's devilishly uncomfortable
to go on living in the house with you
while the thing's unsettled."</p>

<p>Would the visit come into play after all, unless
she consented? Isobel sat in thought.</p>

<p>"Just understood between ourselves&mdash;that's what
I mean. I shan't bother you with much love-making,
as I daresay you can guess."</p>

<p>She had cried out for a fence, a protection.
Did not one offer itself now? It might prove
<a class="pagenum" id="page_252" title="pg 252"></a>
of service. She saw that the man loved her in
his rough way; his love might help her. For
the time, at least, his honest sincerity of affection
touched her heart. His "I want you" was grateful
to her. That other thing&mdash;the thing to which
the stolen kiss belonged&mdash;was madness. Surely
she had resolution to withstand it and to do what
was wise? Surely she could be honest? If only
because, in all likelihood, dishonesty led nowhere.</p>

<p>"Suppose I said yes&mdash;and changed my mind?"
She was trying to be honest&mdash;or perhaps to put
herself in a position to maintain that she had been
honest, if need arose.</p>

<p>"I must take my chance of that, like other men,"
laughed Wellgood. "But, like other men too, I
don't suppose I should be very pleasant about it.
Especially not if there was another fellow!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose you would." She smiled
at him for a moment; he showed there a side of
him that she liked&mdash;his courage, his self-confidence,
his power to stand up for himself.</p>

<p>"You leave it to me to keep you when once I've
got you," he went on, smiling grimly. "That's
my affair; you'll find I shall look after it."</p>

<p>She smiled back at him&mdash;defiance in return for
his grimness. "Very well, I'll leave it to you to
keep me. After all, there's no reason to expect
competition."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_253" title="pg 253"></a>
"Not in Meriton, perhaps! But what of
London, Miss Isobel? I must keep an eye on
you there!" He took hold of her hands and
pulled her to her feet. "It's a promise?"</p>

<p>"In the way I've told you&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's good enough for me!" He drew
her to him and kissed her. "We shan't have
many chances of kissing&mdash;or we should give the
thing away. But give me one now, Isobel!"</p>

<p>She did as she was bid in a very friendly fashion.
His kiss had been hearty but not passionate, and
hers was an adequate response. It left Wellgood
entirely content.</p>

<p>"That's all right! Gad, I feel ten years
younger! You shan't repent it. I'll look after
you well&mdash;while I'm alive and after I'm gone too.
Don't be afraid about that. Perhaps there'll be
somebody else to look after you, by the time I get
notice to quit. I'd like to leave a Wellgood of
Nutley behind me."</p>

<p>"Do you know, that's sentimental?" said Isobel.
"Mere sentiment!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, miss. It's a sound natural
instinct, and I'm proud of it." He kissed her
again. "Now be off, there's a good girl. I've
got a thousand things to do, and probably everything's
been going to the devil while I've been
away."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_254" title="pg 254"></a>
"I rather pity everybody now you've come
back!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry. I know I shall find your
department in good order. Be off!" He took
her by the shoulders in a rough playfulness and
turned her towards the door. She left him chuckling
to himself. He was very content with the
issue of his suit.</p>

<p>Was her department in good order? Her lips
twisted in a wry smile.</p>

<p>As she approached the drawing-room door,
Harry Belfield came out of it. He started a little
to see her&mdash;not that it was strange she should be
there, but because he had not seen her alone since
the night of the stolen kiss. He closed the door
behind him and came to her.</p>

<p>"Vivien"&mdash;a jerk of his head told that Vivien
was in the drawing-room&mdash;"has sent me to say
'How do you do?' to Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>"He's in his study, Mr. Harry. Don't stay
long. He's very busy." She drew aside, to let
him pass, but Harry stood still.</p>

<p>"Are you never going to give me an opportunity?"
he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"An opportunity for what?"</p>

<p>Harry jumped at the chance of his confession
and absolution. "Why, of saying how awfully
sorry and&mdash;and ashamed I am that I yielded&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_255" title="pg 255"></a>
"What's the use of saying anything about it?
It's best forgotten."</p>

<p>"Now Wellgood's back?" he whispered, with
a flash of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Certainly best forgotten, now that Vivien's
father is back."</p>

<p>He shook his head at her with a smile, owning
her skilful parry. "You won't give me one chance?"</p>

<p>"Does the dashing Mr. Harry Belfield need to
have chances given him? I thought he made
them for himself."</p>

<p>Harry's eyes gleamed. "I'll take you at your
word in that!"</p>

<p>"You've been in no hurry about it up to now&mdash;and
you seem in none to say 'How do you do?'
to Mr. Wellgood." She motioned him to go
on, adding, "It was very silly, but no harm's
done. We'll forget."</p>

<p>Harry gave her a long look. She met it with
a steady smile. He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you. We'll forget. There's my hand
on it."</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh, shook her head, and put
her hands behind her back.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember it began that way before,"
she said, and darted past him swiftly.</p>

<p>That was how they set about forgetting the
stolen kiss.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_256" title="pg 256"></a></h2>

<h2>A LOVER LOOKS PALE.</h2>

<p>It speedily appeared that Gilly Foot had other
than pecuniary reasons for wanting a partner;
he wanted a pair of hands to work for him. He
was lazy, at times even lethargic; nothing could
make him hurry. He hated details, and, above all
other details, figures. His work was to hatch
ideas; somebody else had to bring up the chickens.
Andy could hardly have allowed the cool shuffling-off
of all the practical business work on to his
shoulders&mdash;which was what happened as soon as
he had learnt even the rudiments of it&mdash;had it not
been that the ideas were good. The indolent
young man would sit all the morning&mdash;not that
his morning began very early&mdash;apparently doing
nothing, then spend two hours at lunch at the
restaurant, come back smoking a large cigar, and
after another hour's rumination be delivered of an
idea. The budding business&mdash;Andy wondered
how it had even budded under a gardener who no
<a class="pagenum" id="page_257" title="pg 257"></a>
doubt planted but never watered&mdash;lay mainly with
educational works; and here Gilly's ingenuity
came in. He was marvellously good at guessing
what would appeal to a schoolmaster; how or
whence he got this instinct it was impossible to
say; it seemed just a freak of genius. The
prospectus of a new "series," or the "syllabus"
of a new course of study (contained in Messrs.
Gilbert Foot and Co.'s primers) became in his
hands a most skilful bait. And if he hooked one
schoolmaster, as he pointed out to Andy, it was
equivalent to hooking scores, perhaps hundreds,
conceivably thousands, of boys. Girls too perhaps!
Gilly was all for the higher education of girls.
Generations of the youth of both sexes rose before
his prophetically sanguine eye, all brought up on
Gilbert Foot and Co.'s primers.</p>

<p>"A single really good idea for a series may
mean a small fortune, Andy," he would say impressively.
"And now I think I may as well go
to lunch."</p>

<p>Andy accepted the situation and did the hard
work. He also provided his partner with a note-book,
urging him to put down (or, failing that, to
get somebody else to put down) any brilliant idea
which occurred to him at lunch. For himself he
made a rule&mdash;lunch at the restaurant not more than
once a week. Only ideas justified lunch there
<a class="pagenum" id="page_258" title="pg 258"></a>
every day. Lunch there might be good for ideas;
it was not good for figures.</p>

<p>So Andy was working hard, no less hard than
when he was trying to drag his poor timber business
out of the mud, but with far more heart, hope,
and zest. He buckled to the figures; he bargained
with the gentlemen who wrote the primers,
with the printers, and the binders, and the advertisement
canvassers; he tracked shy discounts to
their lairs, and bagged them; his eye on office
expenses was the eye of a lynx. The chickens
hatched by Gilly found a loving and assiduous
foster-mother. And in September, after the new
primers had been packed off to meet the boys going
back to school, Andy was to have a holiday; he
was looking forward to it intensely. He meant to
spend it in attending Harry Belfield on his autumn
campaign in the Meriton Division&mdash;an odd idea of
a holiday to most men's thinking, but Harry was
still Harry, and Andy's appetite for new experiences
had lost none of its voracity. Meanwhile, for
recreation, there was Sunday with its old programme
of church, a tramp, and supper with Jack
Rock; there was lunch on Friday at the restaurant
with the Nun&mdash;she never missed Andy's day&mdash;and
other friends; and on both the Saturdays
which followed the Belfields' return home he was
bidden to dine at Halton.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_259" title="pg 259"></a>
That the Nun had taken a fancy to him he had
been informed by that candid young woman herself;
her assurance that he was "attractive" held
good as regarded Belfield at least; even Andy's
modesty could not deny that. Belfield singled
him out for especial attention, drew him out,
listened to him, advised him. It was at the first
of the two evenings at Halton that he kept Andy
with him after dinner, while the rest went into the
garden&mdash;Wellgood and Vivien were there, but not
Isobel, who had pleaded a cold&mdash;and insisted on
hearing all about his business, listening with evident
interest to Andy's description of it and of his
partner, Gilly Foot.</p>

<p>"And in your holiday you're going to help
Harry, I hear?"</p>

<p>"Help him!" laughed Andy. "I'm going to
listen to him."</p>

<p>"I recommend you to try your own hand too.
You couldn't have a better opportunity of learning
the job than at these village meetings."</p>

<p>"I could never do it. It never entered my
head. Why, I know nothing!"</p>

<p>"More than your audience; that's enough. If
you do break down at first, it doesn't matter.
After a month of it you wouldn't mind Trafalgar
Square."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the idea's absolutely new to me."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_260" title="pg 260"></a>
"So have a lot of things been lately, haven't
they? And they're turning out well."</p>

<p>A slow smile spread over Andy's face. "I
should look a fool," he reflected.</p>

<p>"Try it," said Belfield, quite content with the
reception of his suggestion. He saw that Andy
would turn it over in his mind, would give it full,
careful, impartial consideration. He was coming
to have no small idea of Andy's mind. He passed
to another topic.</p>

<p>"You were at Nutley two or three times when
we were away, Harry tells me. Everything seems
going on very pleasantly?"</p>

<p>Andy recalled himself with a start from his
rumination over a possible speech.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;er&mdash;it looks like it, Mr. Belfield."</p>

<p>"And Harry's not been to town more than once
or twice!" He smiled. "He really seems to have
said farewell to the temptations of London. An
exemplary swain!"</p>

<p>"I think it's going on all right, sir," said
Andy.</p>

<p>Belfield was a little puzzled at his lack of
enthusiasm. Andy showed no actual signs of
embarrassment, but his tone was cold, and his
interest seemed perfunctory.</p>

<p>"I daresay you've been too busy to pay much
attention to such frivolous affairs," he said; but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_261" title="pg 261"></a>
to Andy's ears his voice sounded the least bit
resentful.</p>

<p>"No; I&mdash;I assure you I take the keenest interest
in it. I'd give anything to have it go all
right."</p>

<p>Belfield's eyes were on him with a shrewd kindness.
"No reason to suppose it won't, is there?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of." Now Andy was
frowning a little and smoking rather fast.</p>

<p>Belfield said no more. He could not cross-examine
Andy; indeed he had no materials, even
if he had the right. But Andy's manner left him
with a feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, there's only six weeks to wait for the
wedding!"</p>

<p>The next Saturday found him again at Halton.
One of the six weeks had passed; a week of
happy work, yet somewhat shadowed by the recollection
of Belfield's questions and his own poor
answers. Had he halted midway between honest
truth and useful lying? In fact he knew nothing
of what had been happening of late. He had not
visited Nutley again&mdash;since that night. Suddenly
it struck him that he had not been invited. Then&mdash;did
they suspect? How could they have timed
his entrance so exactly as to suspect? He did not
know that Harry had seen his retreating figure.
Still it would seem to them possible that he might
<a class="pagenum" id="page_262" title="pg 262"></a>
have seen&mdash;possible, if unlikely. That might be
enough to make him a less desired guest.</p>

<p>The great campaign was to begin on the following
Monday, though Andy would not be at leisure
to devote himself to it till a week later. The talk
ran on it. Wellgood, who seemed in excellent
spirits, displayed keen interest in the line Harry
meant to take, and was ready to be chairman whenever
desired. Even Mrs. Belfield herself showed
some mild excitement, and promised to attend one
meeting. The girls were to go to as many as
possible, Vivien being full of tremulous anticipation
of Harry's triumph, Isobel almost as enthusiastic
a partisan. She had met Andy with a
perfection of composure which drove out of his
head any idea that she suspected him of secret
knowledge.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Harry's been overworking himself
over it, poor boy," said Mrs. Belfield. "Don't
you think he looks pale, Mr. Wellgood?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he's found the time to
overwork," Wellgood answered, with a gruff
laugh. "We can account for most of his time
at Nutley."</p>

<p>Harry burst into a laugh, and gulped down
his wine. He was drinking a good deal of
champagne.</p>

<p>"I sigh as a lover, mother," he explained.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_263" title="pg 263"></a>
"That's what makes me pale&mdash;if I am pale."
His tone turned to sudden irritation. "Don't
all look at me. There's nothing the matter."
He laughed again; he seemed full of changes of
mood to-night. "The speeches won't give me
much trouble."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you need have no other trouble,
dear," said Mrs. Belfield, with an affectionate glance
at Vivien.</p>

<p>"He'll have much more trouble with me, won't
he?" Vivien laughed.</p>

<p>Andy stole a look at Isobel. He was filled with
admiration; a smile of just the right degree of
sympathy ornamented her lips. A profane idea
that she must be in the habit of being kissed
crossed his mind. It was difficult to see how she
could be, though&mdash;at Nutley. Kissing takes two.
He did not suspect Wellgood, and he was innocent
himself.</p>

<p>Another eye was watching&mdash;shrewder and more
experienced than Andy's&mdash;watching Harry, watching
Isobel, watching while Andy stole his glance at
Isobel. It was easy to keep bluff Wellgood in the
dark; his own self-confidence hoodwinked him.
Belfield was harder to blind; for those who had
anything to conceal, it was lucky that he did not
live at Nutley.</p>

<p>"Well, waiting for a wedding's tiresome work
<a class="pagenum" id="page_264" title="pg 264"></a>
for all concerned, isn't it?" he said to Isobel, who
sat next him.</p>

<p>"Yes, even waiting for other people's. It's
such a provisional sort of time, Mr. Belfield."</p>

<p>"You've forsworn one set of pleasures, and
haven't got the other yet. You've ceased to be a
rover, and you haven't got a home."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to consider being engaged a
very joyful period?" she smiled.</p>

<p>"On the whole, I don't, Miss Vintry, though
Vivien there looks pretty happy. But it's telling
on Harry, I'm sure."</p>

<p>She looked across at Harry. "Yes, I think it
is a little," came apparently as the result of a
scrutiny suggested by Belfield's words. "I hadn't
noticed it, but I'm afraid you're right."</p>

<p>"If there's anything up, she's a cool hand,"
thought Belfield. "You must try to distract his
thoughts," he told her.</p>

<p>"I try to let them see as little of me as possible."</p>

<p>"Too complete a realization of matrimonial
solitude <i>&agrave; deux</i> before marriage&mdash;Is that advisable?"</p>

<p>"You put too difficult questions for a poor
spinster to answer, Mr. Belfield."</p>

<p>He got nothing out of her, but from the corner
of his eye he saw Harry watching him as he talked
<a class="pagenum" id="page_265" title="pg 265"></a>
to Isobel. Turning his head sharply, he met his
son's glance full and straight. Harry dropped his
eyes suddenly, and again drank off his champagne.
Belfield looked sideways at the composed lady on
his right, and pursed up his lips a little.</p>

<p>Wellgood stayed with him to-night after dinner,
the young men joining the ladies in the garden for
coffee.</p>

<p>"Our friend Miss Vintry's in great good looks
to-night, Wellgood. Remarkably handsome girl!"</p>

<p>"That dress suits her very well. I thought so
myself," Wellgood agreed, well-pleased to have his
secret choice thus endorsed.</p>

<p>Belfield knew nothing of his secret, nothing
of his plans. He was only trying to find out
whether Vivien's father were fully at his ease;
of Isobel's lover and his ease he took no account.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," he laughed, "if I were engaged,
even to a girl as charming as your Vivien,
I should almost feel it an injury to have another
as attractive about all day. 'How happy could I
be with either&mdash;!' you know. The unregenerate
man in one would feel that good material was
being wasted; and my boy used to be rather
unregenerate, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Wellgood smiled in a satisfied fashion. "Even
if Master Harry was disposed to play tricks, I
don't think he'd get much encouragement from&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_266" title="pg 266"></a>
"'T'other dear charmer?' Of course you've
perfect confidence in her, or she wouldn't be where
she is."</p>

<p>"No, nor where she's going to be," thought
Wellgood, enjoying his secret.</p>

<p>"My licentious fancy has wronged my son.
I must have felt a touch of the old Adam myself,
Wellgood. Don't tell my wife."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't tell me, if you knew a bit
more," thought triumphant Wellgood.</p>

<p>"I think Harry's constancy has stood a good
trial. Oh, you'll think I don't appreciate Vivien!
I do; but I know Harry."</p>

<p>Wellgood answered him in kind, with a bludgeon-like
wit. "You'll think I don't appreciate Harry.
I do; but I know Miss Vintry, and she doesn't
care a button about him."</p>

<p>"We proud parents put one another in our
places!" laughed Belfield.</p>

<p>Wellgood saw no danger, and he had been
home a fortnight! True, he had, before that,
been away six weeks. But such mischief, if it
existed, would have grown. If it had been there
during the six weeks, it would have been there, in
fuller growth, during the fortnight. Belfield felt
reassured. He had found out what he wanted,
and yet had given no hint to Vivien's father.
But one or two of his remarks abode in the mind
<a class="pagenum" id="page_267" title="pg 267"></a>
of Isobel's lover, to whom he did not know that
he was speaking. Wellgood's secret position towards
Isobel at once made Belfield's fears, if the
fears were more than a humorous fancy, absurd,
and made them, even though no more than a fancy,
stick. He recked nothing of them as a father;
he remembered them as a lover, yet remembered
only to laugh in his robust security. He thought
it would be a good joke to tell to Isobel, not
realizing that it is never a good joke to tell a
woman that she has been, without cause and
ridiculously, considered a source of danger to
legitimate affections. She may feel this or that
about the charge; she will not feel its absurdity.
She is generally right. Few women pass through
the world without stirring in somebody once or
twice an unruly impulse&mdash;a fact which should incline
them all to circumspection in themselves, and to
charity towards one another, if possible, and at any
rate towards us.</p>

<p>"And what," asked Belfield, with an air of turning
to less important matters, "about the life of
this Parliament?"</p>

<p>Wellgood opined that it would prove much
what a certain philosopher declared the life of
man to be&mdash;nasty, short, and brutish.</p>

<p>In the garden Mrs. Belfield, carefully enfolded
in rugs, dozed the doze of the placid. Isobel
<a class="pagenum" id="page_268" title="pg 268"></a>
and Harry whispered across her unconscious
form.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't drink so much champagne,
Harry."</p>

<p>"Hang it, I want it! I said nothing wrong,
did I?"</p>

<p>"You don't keep control of your eyes. I
think your father noticed. Why look at me?"</p>

<p>"You know I can't help it. And I can't stand
it all much longer."</p>

<p>"You can end it as soon as you like. Am I
preventing you?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Vintry? I'm afraid
I'm drowsy."</p>

<p>"I was just saying I hoped I wasn't preventing
Mr. Harry from strolling with Vivien, Mrs. Belfield."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my dear, of course!" The placid lids
fell over the placid eyes again.</p>

<p>"End it? How?"</p>

<p>"By behaving as Vivien's <i>fianc&eacute;</i> ought."</p>

<p>"Or by not being Vivien's <i>fianc&eacute;</i> any longer?"</p>

<p>"What, Harry love? What's that about not
being Vivien's <i>fianc&eacute;</i> any longer?" Mrs. Belfield
was roused by words admitting of so startling an
interpretation.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall be married soon, shan't we,
mother?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_269" title="pg 269"></a>
"How stupid of me, Harry dear!" Sleep again
descended. Harry swore softly; Isobel laughed low.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous!" she remarked. "Couldn't
you take just one turn with Vivien's companion?
Your mother might hear straight just once."</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I chance it to-night," said
Harry. "I'll take Wellgood on at billiards."</p>

<p>"Yes, go and do that; it's much better. It may
bring back your colour, Harry."</p>

<p>Harry looked at her in exasperation&mdash;and in
longing. "I wish there wasn't a woman in the
world!" he growled.</p>

<p>"It's men like you who say that," she retorted,
smiling. "Go and forget us for an hour."</p>

<p>He went without more words&mdash;with only such a
shrug as he had given when he said good-bye to
Mrs. Freere. Isobel sat on, by dozing Mrs.
Belfield, the picture of a dutiful neglected companion,
while Wellgood and Harry played billiards,
and Belfield, wheezing over an unread evening
paper, honoured her with a tribute of distrustful
curiosity. Left alone in the flesh, she could boast
that she occupied several minds that evening.
Perhaps she knew it, as she sat silent, thoughtfully
gazing across to where Vivien and Andy sat
together, their dim figures just visible in enshrouding
darkness. "He saw&mdash;but he won't
speak!" she was thinking.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_270" title="pg 270"></a>
"How funny of Harry to say he sighed as a
lover!" Vivien remarked to Andy.</p>

<p>Andy had the pride and pleasure of informing
her that her lover was indulging in a quotation
from another lover, more famous and more
temperate.</p>

<p>"'I sighed as a lover. I obeyed as a son.' I
see! How funny! Do you think Gibbon was
right, Mr. Hayes?"</p>

<p>"The oldest question since men had sons and
women had lovers, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't love come first&mdash;when once it has
come?"</p>

<p>"After honour, the poet tells us, Miss Wellgood."</p>

<p>Vivien knew that quotation, anyhow. "It's
beautiful, but isn't it&mdash;just a little priggish?"</p>

<p>"I think we must admit that it's at least a very
graceful apology," laughed Andy.</p>

<p>Their pleasant banter bred intimacy; she was
treating him as an old friend. He felt himself
hardly audacious in saying "How you've grown!"</p>

<p>She understood him&mdash;nay, thanked him with a
smile and a flash, revealing pleasure, from her
eyes, often so reticent. "Am I different from the
days of the lame pony and Curly? Not altogether,
I'm afraid, but I hope a little." She sat silent for
a moment. "I love Harry&mdash;well, so do you."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_271" title="pg 271"></a>
"Yes, I love Harry." But he had a sore
grudge against Harry at that moment. Who at
Halton had once talked about pearls and swine?
And in what connection?</p>

<p>"That's why I'm different." She laughed
softly. "If you'd so far honoured me, Mr. Hayes,
and I had&mdash;responded, I might never have become
different. I should just have relied on the&mdash;policeman."</p>

<p>"The Force is always ready to do its duty," said
Andy.</p>

<p>"Take care; you're nearly flirting!" she admonished
him merrily; and Andy, rather proud of
himself for a gallant remark, laughed and blushed
in answer. She went on more seriously, yet still
with her serene smile. "First I've got to please
him; then I've got to help him. He must have
both, you know."</p>

<p>"Please him, oh, yes! Help him, how?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you know. Poor boy! His ups and
downs! Sometimes he comes to me almost in
despair. It's so hard to help then. Isobel can't
either. He's not happy, you know, to-night."</p>

<p>She had grown. This penetration was new;
should he wish that it might become less or
greater? Less for the sake of her peace, or greater
for her enlightenment's?</p>

<p>"It seems as if a darkness swept over him
<a class="pagenum" id="page_272" title="pg 272"></a>
sometimes, and got between him and me." Her
voice trembled a little. "I want to keep that
darkness away from him; so I mustn't be afraid."</p>

<p>"Whether you're afraid or not, you won't run
away. Remember Curly!"</p>

<p>She turned to him with affectionate friendliness.
"But you'll be there in this too, so far as you can,
won't you? Don't forsake me, will you? It's
sometimes&mdash;very difficult." Her face lit up in a
smile again. "I hope it'll make a man of me, as
father used to say of that odious hunting."</p>

<p>It had, at least, made an end of the mere child
in her. The discernment of her lover's trouble,
the ignorance of whence it came, the need of
fighting it&mdash;she faced these things as part of her
work. Her engagement was no more either
amazement merely, or merely joy. She might
still be afraid of dogs, or shrink from a butcher's
shop. She knew a difficulty when she saw one,
and for love's sake faced it. Andy thought it
made the love dearer to her; with an inward groan
he saw that it did. For he was afraid. What she
told of Harry told more than she could fathom for
herself.</p>

<p>Andy was a partisan. He cried whole-heartedly,
"The pity for Vivien!" He could say, "The pity
for Harry!" for old Harry's sake, and more for
Vivien's. No, "The pity for Isobel!" was breathed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_273" title="pg 273"></a>
in his heart. The case seemed to him a plain one
there; and he was not of the party who would
have the Recording Angel as liberal with tears as
with ink, sedulously obliterating everything that he
punctiliously wrote&mdash;in the end, on that view, a
somewhat ineffectual registrar, who might be spared
both ink and tears, and provided with a retiring
pension by triumphant believers in Necessity. It
may come to that.</p>

<p>"I think Harry may be wanting me." She rose
in her slim grace, and held out a hand to him&mdash;not
in formal farewell, but in an impulse of good-will.
She had come into her heritage of womanhood, and
bore it with a shy stateliness. "Thank you"&mdash;a
pause rather merry than timid&mdash;"Thank you,
policeman Andy."</p>

<p>"No, but I thank you&mdash;and you seem to me
rather like the queen of the fairies."</p>

<p>She smiled, and sighed lightly. "If I can make
the king think so always!"</p>

<p>Then she was gone, a white shadow gliding over
the grass&mdash;a woman now, still in a child's shape.
She flitted past Isobel Vintry, kissing her hand, and
so passed in to where "Harry wanted her."</p>

<p>Politeness dictated that Andy, thus left to
himself, should join his hostess; he did not know
that she was asleep, quite sound asleep by now.</p>

<p>Having sat down before he discovered this state
<a class="pagenum" id="page_274" title="pg 274"></a>
of affairs, he found himself committed to a virtual
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Isobel Vintry, quite the last thing he
desired. He did not find it easy to open the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, we can talk! We shan't disturb her,"
Miss Vintry hastened to assure him with a smile.
"You've been quite a stranger at Nutley. Did
you find the atmosphere too romantic? Too much
love-making for your taste?"</p>

<p>"I did feel rather in the way now and then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were once or twice! When you
attached yourself to Vivien after dinner, and left
Mr. Harry no resource but poor me!"</p>

<p>Surely if she spoke like that&mdash;actually recalling
the critical occasion&mdash;she could have no suspicion?
Either she must never have noticed the shawl
at all, or feel sure that it had been removed
before her talk with Harry reached the point of
danger.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you entertained him very well. I
don't think he'd complain."</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes people like talking over their
affairs with a third person for a change&mdash;as I daresay
Vivien has been doing with you just now!
And, after all, because you're engaged, everybody
else in the world needn't at once seem hopelessly
stupid."</p>

<p>Certainly Isobel Vintry could never seem
<a class="pagenum" id="page_275" title="pg 275"></a>
hopelessly stupid, thought Andy. Rather she was
superbly plausible.</p>

<p>"And perhaps even Mr. Harry may like a rest
from devotion&mdash;or will you be polite enough to
suggest that a temporary change in its object is a
better way of putting it?"</p>

<p>Precisely what it had been in Andy's mind to
suggest&mdash;but not exactly by way of politeness!
It was disconcerting to have the sting drawn from
his thoughts or his talk in this way.</p>

<p>"That might be polite to you&mdash;in one sense;
it might sound rather unjust to Harry," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Am I the first person who has ever dared to
make such an insinuation? How shocking!
But I've even dared to do it to Mr. Harry himself,
and he hardly denied that he was an incorrigible
flirt."</p>

<p>Andy knew that he was no match for her. For
any advantage he could ever win from her, he must
thank chance or surprise.</p>

<p>"Don't be so terribly strict, Mr. Hayes. If you
were engaged, would you like every word&mdash;absolutely
every word&mdash;you said to another girl to
be repeated to your <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>?"</p>

<p>Andy, always honest, considered. "Perhaps I
shouldn't&mdash;and a few pretty speeches hurt nobody."</p>

<p>"Why, really you're becoming quite human!
<a class="pagenum" id="page_276" title="pg 276"></a>
You encourage me to confess that Mr. Harry has
made one or two to me&mdash;and I've not repeated
them to Vivien. I'm relieved to find you don't
think me a terrible sinner."</p>

<p>She was skilfully pressing for an indication of
what he knew, of how much he had seen&mdash;without
letting him, if he did know too much, have a chance
of confronting her openly with his knowledge.
Must he be considered in the game she was playing,
or could he safely be neglected?</p>

<p>Andy's temper was rather tried. She talked of
a few idle words, a few pretty speeches&mdash;ordinary
gallantries. His memory was of two figures tense
with passion, and of a lover's kiss accepted as
though by a willing lover.</p>

<p>"How far would you carry the doctrine?" he
asked dryly.</p>

<p>There was a pause before she answered; she
was shaping her reply so that it might produce the
result she wanted&mdash;information, yet not confrontation
with his possible knowledge.</p>

<p>"As far as a respectful kiss?" Peering through
the darkness, she saw a quick movement of Andy's
head. Instantly she added with a laugh, "On the
hand, I mean, of course!"</p>

<p>"You won't ask me to go any further, if I admit
that?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"No. I'll agree with you on that," she said.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_277" title="pg 277"></a>
Mrs. Belfield suddenly woke up. "Yes, I'm
sure Harry's looking pale," she remarked.</p>

<p>Isobel had got her information; she was sure
now. The sudden movement of Andy's head had
been too startled, too outraged, to have been
elicited merely by an audacious suggestion put
forward in discussion; it spoke of memories
roused; it expressed wonder at shameless effrontery.
Andy had revealed his knowledge, but he did not
know that he had. He had parted with his secret;
yet it had become no easier for him to meddle. If
he had thought himself bound to say nothing, not
to interfere, before, he would seem to himself so
bound still. And if he tried to meddle, at least
she would be fighting now with her eyes open.
There might be danger&mdash;there could be no
surprise.</p>

<p>When Harry Belfield put on her cloak for her in
the hall, she whispered to him: "Take care of
Andy Hayes! He did see us that first night."</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV.<a class="pagenum" id="page_278" title="pg 278"></a></h2>

<h2>SAVING THE NATION.</h2>

<p>On a fine afternoon Jack Rock stood smoking
his pipe on the pavement of High Street.
His back was towards the road, his face turned to
his own shop-window, where was displayed a poster
of such handsome dimensions that it covered nearly
the whole of the plate glass, to the prejudice of
Jack's usual display of mutton and beef. He took
no account of that; he was surveying the intruding
poster with enormous complacency. It announced
that there would be held, under the auspices of the
Meriton Conservative and Unionist Association,
an open-air Public Meeting that evening on Fyfold
Green. Chairman&mdash;The Rt. Hon. Lord Meriton
(his lordship was rarely "drawn;" his name indicated
a great occasion). Speakers&mdash;William
Foot, Esq., K. C., M. P. (very large letters); Henry
Belfield, Esq., Prospective Candidate etc. (letters
not quite so large); and Andrew Hayes, Esq.
(letters decidedly smaller, but still easily legible
<a class="pagenum" id="page_279" title="pg 279"></a>
from across the street). Needless to say that it
was the sight of the last name which caused Mr.
Jack Rock's extreme complacency. He had put
up the stakes; now he was telling himself that the
"numbers" were up for the race. Andy was in
good company&mdash;too good, of course, for a colt like
him on the present occasion; but in Jack's mind
the race comprised more than one meeting. There
was plenty of time for the colt to train on! Meanwhile
there he was, on a platform with Lord Meriton,
with Mr. Foot, King's Counsel, Member of
Parliament (Jack's thoughts rehearsed these titles&mdash;the
former of which Billy had recently achieved&mdash;at
full length, for all the world like the toastmaster
at a public dinner), and Mr. Henry Belfield,
Prospective Candidate etc. Mr. Rock hurled at
himself many contemptuous and opprobrious
epithets when he recollected the career which he
had once offered for the grateful acceptance of
Andrew Hayes, Esq. To him the poster was a
first and splendid dividend on the three thousand
pounds which Miss Doris Flower had so prettily
extracted from his pocket. Here was his return;
he willingly left to Andy the mere pecuniary fruits
of the investment.</p>

<p>Thus immensely gratified, Jack refused to own
that he was surprised. The autumn campaign had
now been in progress nearly three weeks, and,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_280" title="pg 280"></a>
although Andy had not been heard before in
Meriton, reports of his doings had come in from
outlying villages with which Jack had business
dealings. Nay, Mr. Belfield of Halton himself,
who had braved the evening air by going to one
meeting to hear his son, found time to stop at the
shop and tell Jack that he had been favourably impressed
by Andy.</p>

<p>"No flowers of rhetoric, Jack," he said with
twinkling eyes, "such as my boy indulges in, but
good sound sense&mdash;knows his facts. I shouldn't
wonder if the labourers like that better. He knows
what their bacon costs 'em, and how many loaves
a week go to a family of six, and so on. I heard
one or two old fellows saying 'Aye, that's right!'
half a dozen times while he was speaking. I wish
our old friend at the grammar school could have
heard him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Belfield; the old gentleman would
have been proud, wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"And you've a right to be proud, Jack. I know
what you've done for the lad."</p>

<p>"He's a good lad, sir. He comes to supper
with me every Sunday, punctual, when he's in
Meriton."</p>

<p>"You've every reason to hope he'll do very well&mdash;a
sensible steady fellow! It'd be a good thing
if there were more like him."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_281" title="pg 281"></a>
Then Chinks and the Bird had made an excursion
on their bicycles to hear Andy, and brought
back laudatory accounts&mdash;this though Chinks was
suspected of Radical leanings, which he was not
allowed by his firm to obtrude. And old Cox had
heard him and pronounced the verdict that, though
he might be no flyer like Mr. Harry, yet he had
the makings of a horse in him. "Wants work,
and can stand as much as you give him," said
Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>Immersed in a contemplation of the placard and
in the reflections it evoked, Mr. Rock stepped
backwards into the road in order to get a new view
of the relative size of the lettering. Thereby he
nearly lost his life, and made Andy present possessor
of a tidy bit of money for which, in the
natural course, he would have to wait many years.
(This is trenching on old Jack's darling secret.)
The agitated hoot of a motor-car sent him on a
jump back to the pavement, just in time. The car
came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"I didn't come all this way on purpose to kill
you, Mr. Rock!"</p>

<p>Jack had turned round already, in order to swear
at his all but murderer, who might reasonably have
pleaded contributory negligence. Angry words
died away. A small figure, enveloped in a dust
cloak, wrapped about the head with an infinite
<a class="pagenum" id="page_282" title="pg 282"></a>
number of yards of soft fabric, sat alone in the back
of the car. The driver yawned, surveying Meriton
with a scornful air, appearing neither disturbed by
Mr. Rock's danger nor gratified by his escape.</p>

<p>"It's so convenient," the small figure proceeded
to observe, "when people have their names written
over their houses. Still I think I should have
known you without that. Andy has described you
to me, you see."</p>

<p>"Why, it's never&mdash;?" The broadest smile spread
on Jack Rock's face.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it is! I always keep my word. I'm
taking a holiday, and I thought I'd combine my
visit to you with&mdash;" She suddenly broke off her
sentence, and gave a gurgle. Jack thought it a
curiously pleasant sound. "Why, there it is!"
the Nun gurgled, pointing a finger at the wonderful
placard in Jack's window.</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;you're Miss Flower?" gasped Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;but look at it! Those three boys!
Billy, and Harry&mdash;and Andy! Andy! Well, of
course, one knows they do do things, but somehow
it's so hard to realise. I shall certainly stay for the
meeting! Seymour, let me out!"</p>

<p>Seymour got down in a leisurely fashion, hiding
a yawn with one hand and a cigarette in the other.
"I suppose there isn't a hotel in this place,
Miss Flower?" he remarked. (Seymour always
<a class="pagenum" id="page_283" title="pg 283"></a>
called the Nun "Miss Flower," never merely
"Miss.")</p>

<p>"Oh yes; the Lion, Seymour. Excellent hotel,
isn't it, Mr. Rock? Kept by Mr. Dove, who's
got a son named the Bird; and the Bird's got a
friend named Chinks, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you do beat creation!" cried Jack.
"How do you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Secret sources of information!" said the Nun
gravely. "Have I got to go to the Lion, Mr.
Rock? Or&mdash;or what time do you have tea?"</p>

<p>"You'll have tea with me, miss?" cried Jack.</p>

<p>"At what hour will you require the car, Miss
Flower?" asked Seymour.</p>

<p>"You're goin' to the meetin', miss? Tell the
young chap to be round at six, and mind he's
punctual."</p>

<p>"Do as Mr. Rock says, Seymour," smiled the
Nun. It was part of the day's fun to hear Seymour
ordered about&mdash;and called a young chap!&mdash;by the
butcher of Meriton. But she could not get into
the house without another look at the poster.
"Billy, Harry&mdash;and Andy! I wonder if those
boys really imagine that what they say or think
matters!"</p>

<p>Miss Flower was already a privileged person.
Jack had no rebuke for her profanity. She took
his arm, saying,</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_284" title="pg 284"></a>
"I want to see the shop. You wanted Andy to
have the shop, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I was an old fool. I&mdash;I meant it well, Miss
Flower."</p>

<p>The Nun squeezed his arm.</p>

<p>"Were these nice animals when they were alive,
Mr. Rock?"</p>

<p>"Prime uns, alive or dead!" chuckled Jack.
"You come back to supper, after the meetin', miss,
and taste; but maybe you'll be goin' back to
London, or takin' your supper at Halton?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I've promised to take Billy Foot
back to town. Oh, but tea now, Mr. Rock!"</p>

<p>Not even the messenger boy whom she had sent
enjoyed Jack Rock's tea more than the Nun herself.
For a girl of her inches, she ate immensely; even
more heartily she praised. Jack could hardly eat
at all, she was so daintily wonderful, her being
there at all so amazing. Seeking explanation of
the marvel, the simple affectionate old fellow could
come only on one. She must be very fond of
Andy! She had written to plead for Andy; she
came and had tea with the old butcher&mdash;because he
had given Andy help. And now she was lauding
Andy, telling him in her quiet way that his lad was
much thought of by her and her smart friends in
London. Jack had, of course, a very inadequate
realisation of what "smartness" in London really
<a class="pagenum" id="page_285" title="pg 285"></a>
meant&mdash;a view which some might have called both
inadequate and charitable.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a fine lad, miss. I say, the girl as
gets Andy'll be lucky!" (That "as" always
tripped Jack up in moments of thoughtlessness.)</p>

<p>The Nun deliberately disposed of a piece of
plum cake and a sip of tea&mdash;the latter to wash the
former down.</p>

<p>"I don't fall in love myself," she observed, in a
tone decided yet tolerant&mdash;as though she had said,
"I don't take liqueurs myself&mdash;but if you like to
risk it!"</p>

<p>"You miss the best thing in life, miss," Jack
cried.</p>

<p>"And most of the worst too," added the Nun
serenely.</p>

<p>"Don't say it, miss. It don't come well from
your pretty lips."</p>

<p>"Have I put you on your mettle? I meant to,
of course, Mr. Rock."</p>

<p>Old Jack slapped his thigh, laughing immensely.
Now wasn't this good&mdash;that she should be here,
having tea, getting at him like that?</p>

<p>It was a happy conjuncture, for the Nun was
hardly less well pleased. She divided her life into
two categories; one was "the mill," the other was
"fun." The mill included making a hundred and
eighty pounds by singing two silly songs eight times
<a class="pagenum" id="page_286" title="pg 286"></a>
each every week, being much adored, and eating
meals at that restaurant; "fun" meant anything
rather different. Having tea with Jack Rock, the
Meriton butcher, was rather different, and Miss
Flower (as Seymour called her&mdash;almost the only
person who did) was enjoying herself.</p>

<p>"I should like to take a walk along the street
before we go to the meeting, Jack."</p>

<p>"Jack," casually dropped, with no more than a
distant twinkle, finished Mr. Rock.</p>

<p>"Your letter was pretty good, but you, miss&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I'm considered attractive on a postcard. It
costs a penny," said the Nun, rising, fully refreshed,
from the table. "Take me to the Lion, please.
I must see that Seymour isn't dissatisfied. He's a
gentleman by birth, you know, and a chauffeur by
profession. So he rather alarms me, though his
manner is always carefully indifferent." This remark
of hers suddenly pleased the Nun. She
gurgled; her own rare successes always gratified
her&mdash;witness that somewhat stupid story about the
two ladies and Tommy, told a long while ago.</p>

<p>Accompanied by proud Jack Rock, she traversed
Meriton High Street, greatly admiring the church,
the grammar school, and that ancient and respectable
hostelry, the Lion. Indeed she fell so much
in love with the Lion that she questioned Jack as
to the accommodation it provided, and was assured
<a class="pagenum" id="page_287" title="pg 287"></a>
that it boasted a private sitting-room, with oak
panelling and oak beams across the ceiling (always
supposed to be irresistible attractions to London
visitors), and bedrooms sufficient in case she and
Miss Dutton should be minded to spend a part of
their holiday there. Room also for a maid&mdash;and
for Seymour and the motor. "It's rather a nice
idea. I'll think it over," she said.</p>

<p>Then it was time to think about the meeting;
and Jack must come with her in the car, sit with
her, and tell her all about it. "Oh yes, you
must!"</p>

<p>"I shall never hear the last of it, long as I
live!" Jack protested, half in delight, half in a real
shyness.</p>

<p>Behold them, then, thus installed on the outskirts
of the meeting, with a good view of the
platform where "the boys" were seated, together
with Wellgood, supporting the great Lord Meriton.
Vivien and Isobel also had chairs at the back. The
Nun produced a field-glass from a pocket in the
car, and favoured these ladies with a steady inspection.
"Which did you say was Harry's?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"The fair one, miss&mdash;that's Miss Wellgood."</p>

<p>"The other's quite good-looking too," the Nun
pronounced.</p>

<p>The salient features of Mr. Foot's oratory have
<a class="pagenum" id="page_288" title="pg 288"></a>
been indicated on a previous occasion. This evening
he surpassed himself in epigram and logic; no
doubt he desired to overcome the Nun's obstinate
scepticism as to his career, no less than to maintain
his popularity in Meriton. For the Nun he had
a special treat&mdash;a surprise. He told them her
story of Tommy and the two ladies, slightly adapting
it to the taste of a general audience; the
cheques were softened down to invitations to <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
dinners, couched in highly affectionate language.
In Billy's apologue the Ministry was
Tommy, one of the ladies was Liberalism, the
other Socialism. The apologue took on very well;
Billy made great play with Tommy's double flirtation,
and the Ministry's double flirtation, ending
up, "Yes, gentlemen, there will be only one tip
to pay the waiter, but that'll be a tip-over, if I'm
not much mistaken!" (Cheers and laughter.)</p>

<p>The Nun was smiling all over her face. "That
really was rather clever of Billy." She felt herself
shining with reflected glory.</p>

<p>But Billy&mdash;astute electioneerer&mdash;meant to get
more out of the Nun than just that Tommy story.
When he had finished a wonderful peroration, in
which he bade Meriton decide once and for all&mdash;it
would probably never have another chance
before it was too late&mdash;between Imperial greatness
and Imperial decay, he slipped from the platform,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_289" title="pg 289"></a>
and made his way round the skirts of the meeting
to her motor-car. Lord Meriton's compliments,
and would Miss Flower oblige him and delight
the meeting by singing the National Anthem at the
close of the proceedings? The Nun was so
agitated by this request that she lost most of
Andy's speech; he was sandwiched in between the
more famous orators. As Andy&mdash;from what she
did hear&mdash;appeared to be talking about loaves, and
sugar, and bacon, and things of that sort, she was
of opinion that she was not missing very much,
and was surprised to see the men listening and the
bareheaded women nodding approvingly and nudging
one another in the ribs. "He's jolly good!
Upon my word, he is," said Billy Foot suddenly,
and old Jack chuckled delightedly. When Andy
sat down, without any peroration, she said to Billy,
"Was he good? It sounded rather dull to me.
Yours was fine, Billy!"</p>

<p>"Awfully glad you liked it. But they'll forget
my jokes; they'll talk about old Andy's figures
when they get home. Every woman in the place'll
want to prove 'em right or wrong. Gad, how he
must have mugged all that up!"</p>

<p>Then came Harry; to him she listened, at him
she looked. Whatever the difficulties of his
private life might be, they did not avail to spoil
his speaking; it is conceivable that they improved
<a class="pagenum" id="page_290" title="pg 290"></a>
it, since nerves on the strain sometimes result in
brilliant flashes. And he looked so handsome,
with pale, eager, excited face. He could fall in
love with a subject almost as deeply, almost as
quickly, as with a woman, and for the moment be
hardly less devoted to it, heart and soul. Perhaps
he was a little over the heads of most of his
audience, but they knew that it was a fine performance
and were willing to take for granted some
things which they did not understand.</p>

<p>"That's talking, that is!" said a man near the
car. "Mr. Harry's the one to give ye that."</p>

<p>Of course the Nun was persuaded in the matter
of the National Anthem. Billy led her round to
the platform, where Lord Meriton welcomed her,
and introduced her to the meeting as Miss Doris
Flower, the famous London singer, who had
kindly consented to sing the National Anthem.
For once in her life the Nun was very nervous,
but she sang. Her sweet voice and her remarkable
prettiness stormed the meeting. They would
have another song. The applause brought back
her confidence. Before she had become a nun or
a Quaker she had once been, in early days, a
Cameron Highlander. A couple of martial and
patriotic ditties remained in her memory; she
gave them one, and excited enthusiasm. They
cried for more&mdash;more! An encore was insisted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_291" title="pg 291"></a>
upon. In spite of the brilliant speakers, the Nun
was the heroine of the evening. She bowed, she
smiled, she fell altogether in love with Meriton.
Thoughts of the Lion rose strongly in her mind.</p>

<p>"A great success, and we owe a great deal of it
to you, Miss Flower," said the noble chairman.
"You just put the crown on it all. I wish we
could have you here at election time!"</p>

<p>The whole platform besought the Nun to come
down at election time with more patriotic songs.
Most urgent was the pretty, slight, fair girl who
was Harry Belfield's <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. Her eyes were so
friendly and gentle that the Nun could refuse her
nothing.</p>

<p>"At one bound, Doris, you've become a personage
in Meriton," laughed Billy Foot.</p>

<p>"She's a personage wherever she goes," said
Andy in frank and affectionate admiration.</p>

<p>The Nun gurgled happily. But where was her
old friend Harry with his congratulations? He
had greeted her, but not with much enthusiasm;
he was now talking to the other girl&mdash;Miss Vintry&mdash;in
a low voice, with a frown on his face; he
looked weary and spent. She moved over to him
and laid her hand on his arm; he started violently.</p>

<p>"I'll never laugh at you about your speeches
again, Harry. But, poor old fellow, how done up
you look!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_292" title="pg 292"></a>
"Doing this sort of thing every night's pretty
tiring."</p>

<p>"Besides all the other things you have to do
just now! I think I must come and stay at the
Lion and look after you."</p>

<p>Harry looked at her with an expression that
puzzled her; it almost seemed like resentment,
though the idea was surely absurd. Miss
Vintry said nothing; she stood by in silent composure.</p>

<p>"You're thinking of&mdash;of coming to Meriton?"</p>

<p>"I had an idea of it, for a week or two. I'm
doing nothing, you know. Sally would come
with me."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd find it awfully dull,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>The Nun could not make him out. Was he
ashamed of her? Did he not want her to know
Miss Wellgood, his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>? It almost looked
like that. The Nun was a little hurt. She was
aware that certain people held certain views; but
Harry was an old, old friend. "Well, if I do
come and find it dull, you needn't feel responsible.
You haven't pressed me, have you?" and with a
little laugh she went back to more expansive
friends.</p>

<p>"That'd make another of them, and she's infernally
sharp!" Harry said to Isobel Vintry, in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_293" title="pg 293"></a>
that low careful voice to which he was nowadays
so much addicted.</p>

<p>"Oh well, we can't keep it up this way long
anyhow," she answered, and sauntered off to join
Vivien.</p>

<p>With Billy, with Andy, as with old Jack, the
Nun found enthusiasm enough and to spare.</p>

<p>"How perfectly ripping an idea!" cried Billy.
"Because Harry's governor had asked me to stay
a fortnight at Halton, and do half a dozen more
meetings; and I'm going to. And Andy'll be
down here too. Why, we shall all be together!
You come, Doris!"</p>

<p>Her hurt feelings found expression. "Harry
didn't seem to want me when I spoke to him
about it."</p>

<p>Billy Foot looked at her curiously. "Oh, didn't
he?" Andy had moved off with Jack Rock.
"It's a funny thing, but I don't think he wants
me at Halton. He was far from enthusiastic. If
you ask me, Doris, there's something wrong with
him. Overworked, I suppose. Oh, but he can't
be; these little meetings are no trouble."</p>

<p>"If I want to come, I shall. Only one doesn't
like the idea that one's friends are ashamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, rot, it can't be that! That's not a bit
like Harry."</p>

<p>"He's engaged now, you know."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_294" title="pg 294"></a>
"Well, I can't see why that should make any
difference. He's got the blues over something or
other; never mind him. You come, you and
Sally."</p>

<p>She lowered her voice. "Can it be because of
poor old Sally?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so. He's always been
awfully kind about that wretched old business."</p>

<p>"It's something," she persisted with a vexed
frown.</p>

<p>Vivien Wellgood came up to them with Andy.
"Mr. Hayes tells me you may possibly come to
Meriton for a stay, Miss Flower. I do hope you
will. The Lion's quite good, and we'll all do all
we can to amuse you, if only you'll sing to us just
now and then. Do say you'll come; don't only
think about it!"</p>

<p>"Your being so kind makes me want to come
more," said the Nun. "Oh, and I do congratulate
you, Miss Wellgood. I hope you'll be ever so
happy."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I hope so," said Vivien softly,
her eyes assuming their veiled look.</p>

<p>The car was waiting; Seymour was yawning
and looking at his watch. The Nun said her
farewells, but not one to Harry Belfield, who had
already strolled off along the road. Not very
polite of Harry!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_295" title="pg 295"></a>
"Did you like the speeches, Seymour?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foot, of course, is a good speaker. The
other gentlemen did very well for such a meeting as
this, Miss Flower. Mr. Belfield is very promising."</p>

<p>"Was I in good voice?"</p>

<p>"Very fair. But you had better not use it
much in the open air. Not good for the chords,
Miss Flower."</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had skilfully tucked her in with
Billy Foot, and off they went, Billy comforting
himself after his labours with a pull at his flask
and a very big cigar.</p>

<p>"I've made you do some work for the good
cause to-night, Doris," he remarked. "A song
or two goes jolly well at a meeting."</p>

<p>"Thinking of enlisting me in your own service?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"You'd be uncommon valuable. The man
they're putting up against me has got a pretty
wife." Billy allowed himself a glance; it met
with inadequate appreciation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll come and sing for you if you ask me,
Billy." Her voice sounded absent. She was
enjoying the motion and the air, but her thoughts
were with Vivien Wellgood, the girl who had been
so kind, and whose eyes had gone blank when the
Nun wished her happiness.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_296" title="pg 296"></a>
"Yes, Harry's off colour," said Billy, puffing
away with much enjoyment. "He can't take anything
right; didn't even like your story!"</p>

<p>"Why, you brought it in so cleverly, Billy!"</p>

<p>"Harry asked me what I thought they'd make
of that kind of rot. It seemed to me they took it
all right. Rather liked it, didn't they?"</p>

<p>The Nun turned to him suddenly. "That girl
isn't happy."</p>

<p>"There's something up!" Billy concluded.</p>

<p>"Do you know that Miss Vintry well?"</p>

<p>Billy took his cigar out of his mouth and looked
at her. "You do jump to conclusions."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Harry better than any of you."</p>

<p>"Do you?" he asked, seeming just a little disturbed.</p>

<p>The Nun marked his disturbance with a side
glance of amusement, but she was not diverted
from the main line of her thoughts. "He doesn't
want me to come to Meriton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Doris, did Harry Belfield ever try
to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Tales out of school? I thought you knew me,
Billy."</p>

<p>The reproach carried home to Billy. There had
been one occasion when, over-night, his career had
seemed not so imperative, and Doris had seemed
very imperative indeed, demanding vows and protestations
<a class="pagenum" id="page_297" title="pg 297"></a>
of high fervour, bearing only one legitimate
interpretation. This happened long before
Billy was K.C. or M.P., and when his income was
still meagre. The morning had brought back
counsel, and thoughts of the career. Billy had
written a letter. The next time they met, she had
taken occasion to observe that she always burnt
letters, just as she never fell in love. The episode
was not among Billy's proudest recollections. In
telling Andy that Billy had always pulled himself
up on the brink, the Nun had been guilty of just
this one suppression. No tales out of school was
always her motto.</p>

<p>"If he does come to grief, it'll be over a
woman," said Billy. He took a big puff. "That's
the only thing worth coming to grief over, either,"
he added, looking into his companion's eyes.</p>

<p>"What about the great cause I sang for?" she
asked, serenely evasive. Sentiment in a motor-car
at night really does not count.</p>

<p>Billy laughed. "I do my best for my client."</p>

<p>"But you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, I believe we've got, say, seven points
out of ten. So we ought to get the verdict."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's honest enough. You leave
the other side to put their three points?"</p>

<p>"That oughtn't to be over-straining them,"
Billy opined.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_298" title="pg 298"></a>
"Politics are rather curious. I might go to
another meeting or two while I'm at Meriton; but
I won't sing out of doors any more. Seymour
doesn't approve of it."</p>

<p>"You're really going to take rooms there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if Sally consents." She turned round to
him. "Do you know what it is to see somebody
asking for help?"</p>

<p>"To me they always call it temporary assistance."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, I think I saw that to-night."
She was silent a minute, then she gurgled. "And
really they're all great fun, you know."</p>

<p>"I look forward to our stay at Meriton with the
gravest apprehension," said Billy Foot.</p>

<p>The Nun looked at him, smiled, looked away,
looked back once more.</p>

<p>"Well, I shall have nothing else to do&mdash;in the
way of recreation," she said.</p>

<p>A long silence followed. Billy threw away the
stump of his cigar.</p>

<p>"Hang it, he's got the style, that fellow has!"</p>

<p>"Who's got what style?" asked the Nun. Her
voice sounded drowsy.</p>

<p>"What the House likes&mdash;Andy."</p>

<p>"What house?" drawled the Nun, terribly and
happily sleepy.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a lively girl to drive home with in
a motor at night!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_299" title="pg 299"></a>
Her eyes were closed, her lips ever so little
parted. Half asleep, still she smiled. He made
a trumpet of his hands and shouted into her ear.
"The House of Commons, stupid!"</p>

<p>"Don't tickle my ear," said the Nun. "And
try if you can't be quiet!"</p>

<h2>Chapter XV.<a class="pagenum" id="page_300" title="pg 300"></a></h2>

<h2>LOVE AND FEAR.</h2>

<p>Well might Harry Belfield be subject to fits
of temper and impatience! Well might
he show signs of wear and tear not to be accounted
for by the labours of a mild political campaign,
carried on under circumstances of great amenity!
He had fallen into a state of feeling which forbade
peace within, and made security from without impossible.
He was terribly at war in his soul. If
he could have put the case so simply as that,
being pledged to one girl, he had fallen in love
with another, he would have had a plain solution
open to him: he could break the engagement,
facing the pain that he gave and the discredit that
he suffered. His feelings admitted of no such
straightforward remedy. The beliefs and the aspirations
with which he had wooed Vivien were not
dead; they were struggling for life against their
old and mighty enemy. For him Vivien still
meant happiness, and more than happiness&mdash;a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_301" title="pg 301"></a>
haven for anything that was good in him, a refuge
from all that was bad. With all his instincts of
pure affection, of loyalty and chivalry, still he
loved her and clung to her. She it was still who
had power to comfort and soothe him, to send
him forth able to do his work again. She was
the best thing in his life; she seemed to him well-nigh
his only chance against himself. Was he to
throw the last chance away?</p>

<p>Then why not be true? Why deceive when he
loved? Every day, nay, every hour, that question
had to be asked in scorn and answered in bitterness.
His happiness lay with one; the present
desire of his eyes was for another. His mind
towards Isobel was strange: often he hardly
liked her; sometimes his hatred for what she
was doing to his life made him almost hate
her; always his passion for her was strong and
compelling. Since the stolen kiss had set it
aflame, it had spread and spread through him,
fed by their secret interviews, till it seemed now
to consume all his being in one fierce blaze.
How could affectionate and loyal instincts stand
against it? Yet he hated it. All the good of his
nature his kindliness, his amiability, his chivalry&mdash;hated
it. He was become as it were two men;
and the one reviled the other. But when he
reviled the passion in him as the murderer of all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_302" title="pg 302"></a>
his happiness, it answered with a fell insinuation.
Why these heroics and this despair? Why talk
of happiness being murdered? There was another
way. "Don't murder happiness for me," passion
urged slyly. "I am violent, but I am a passing
thing. You know how often I have come to you,
and raged, and passed by. There's another way."
That whisper was ever in his ears, and would not
be silenced. That it might gain its end, his
passion subtly minimized itself; it sought to enter
into an unnatural alliance with his better part;
it prayed in aid his purer love, his tottering
loyalty, his old-time chivalry. A permanent reconciliation
with these it could not, and dared not,
ask; but a <i>modus vivendi</i> till it, transitory thing as
it was, should pass away? So the tempter tempted
with all his cunning.</p>

<p>Avoiding plain words for what that way was,
he was seduced into asking whether it were open.
He could not answer. Through all the stolen
interviews, through other stolen kisses, he had
never come to the knowledge of Isobel's heart and
mind. He could read no more than she chose
to let him read. She allowed his flirtation and
his kisses, but almost scornfully. When he declared
his state to be intolerable, she told him it
was easy to end it&mdash;easy to end either the engagement
or the flirtation at his option. She had not
<a class="pagenum" id="page_303" title="pg 303"></a>
owned to love. A certain sour amusement seemed
to lie for her in the affair. "We're a pair of
fools," her eyes seemed to say when he embraced
her, "but it doesn't much matter; nothing can
come of it, and it'll soon be all over." When he
saw that look, his old desire for conquest came
over him; he was impelled at any cost to break
down this indifference, to make his sway complete.
Of her relations towards Wellgood she had flatly
refused to say another word. "The less we talk
about that just now the better." In some such
phrase she always forbade the topic. There again
he was left in an uncertainty which stung his
pride and bred a fierce jealousy. By what she
gave and what she withheld, by her silence no
less than by her words, she inflamed his passion.
She yielded enough to fill him with desire and
hope of a full triumph; but even though she
yielded, though her voice might falter and her
eyes drop, she did not own love's mastery yet.</p>

<p>Thus torn and rent within, from without he
seemed ringed round with enemies. Eyes that
must needs be watchful were all about him.
There was Andy Hayes with his chance knowledge
of the first false step; Wellgood, who must
have a jealous vigilance for the woman whom he
had at least thought of making his wife; his own
father, with his shrewd estimate of his son and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_304" title="pg 304"></a>
acquaintance with past histories; Vivien herself,
to whom he must still play devoted lover, with
whom most spare hours must still be spent. To
add to all these, now there came this girl from
London! She had knowledge of past histories
too; she had the sharpest of eyes; he feared even
the directness of her tongue. Andy had seen, but
not spoken; he did not trust Doris, if she saw,
not to speak. He was terribly afraid of her.
Small wonder that the suggestion of her stay at
the Lion had called forth no enthusiasm from
him! She took rank as an enemy the more. And
Billy Foot was to be at Halton! She and Billy
would lay their heads together and talk. Out of
talk would come suspicion, out of suspicion more
watchfulness. It was no business of theirs, but
they would watch.</p>

<p>Political campaigning amidst all this! Well, in
part it was a relief. The speeches and their preparation
perforce occupied his mind for the time;
on his platforms he forgot. Yet to go away&mdash;to
leave Nutley for so many hours&mdash;seemed to his
overwrought fancy a sore danger. What might
happen while he was away? To what state of
things might he any evening come back? Vivien
might have revealed suspicions to Wellgood, or
Wellgood might have challenged Isobel and compelled
an answer. Once when Andy did not come
<a class="pagenum" id="page_305" title="pg 305"></a>
to the meeting, he made sure that he had stayed
behind on purpose to reveal his knowledge to
Vivien or her father, and the evening was a long
torture which no speeches could deaden, no applause
allay.</p>

<p>In this fever of conflict and of fear his days
passed. At this cost he bought the joy of the
stolen interviews&mdash;that joy so mixed with doubt,
so tainted by pain, so assailed by remorse. Yet
for him so tense, so keen, so surcharged with the
great primitive struggle. Ten minutes stolen once
a day&mdash;it seldom came to more than that. Now
and then, when he had no political excursion, a
second ten, late at night, after his ostensible departure
from Nutley. When he had "gone home,"
when Vivien had been sent to bed, and Wellgood
had repaired to his pipe in the study, Isobel would
chance to wander down the drive, looking into the
waters of the lake, and he, lingering by the gate,
see her and come back. Whether she would
saunter out or not he never knew. Waiting to see
whether she would seemed waiting for the fate of
a lifetime.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;a week after the Fyfold Green
meeting, a day after the Nun had taken possession
of her quarters at the Lion&mdash;Harry had dined at
Nutley and&mdash;gone home.</p>

<p>Isobel stole stealthily out; she had a quarter
<a class="pagenum" id="page_306" title="pg 306"></a>
of an hour before doors would be locked. She
strolled down the drive, a long dark cloak hiding
the white dress which would have shown too conspicuously.
As she went she dropped a letter;
coming back she would pick it up. If any one
asked why she had come out, the answer was&mdash;to
find that letter, accidentally dropped. There had
never been need of the excuse yet; it was still
available.</p>

<p>Harry came swiftly, yet warily, back from the
gate. For a fleeting instant all his being seemed
satisfied. But she stretched out her arms, holding
him off.</p>

<p>"No, I want to say something, Harry. This&mdash;this
has gone on long enough. To-morrow I
want you to know&mdash;only Miss Vintry!" There
was the break in her voice; it was too dark to see
her eyes.</p>

<p>"That's impossible," he answered, very low.</p>

<p>"Everything else is impossible, you mean."
Her voice faltered again&mdash;into a tenderness new
to him, filling him with rapture. "You're dying
of it, poor boy! End it, Harry! I watched you
to-night. Oh, you're tired to death&mdash;do you ever
sleep? End it, Harry&mdash;because I can't."</p>

<p>So she had broken at last, her long fencing
ended, her strong composure gone. "I can't
bear it for you any longer. Have the strength.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_307" title="pg 307"></a>
Go back to&mdash;" She broke into tremulous laughter.
"Go back to duty, Harry&mdash;and forget this
nonsense."</p>

<p>"Come to me, Isobel!"</p>

<p>"No, I daren't. From to-morrow there is&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>He caught the arms that would have defended
her face. "You love me?"</p>

<p>Her smile was piteous. "Not after to-night!"</p>

<p>His triumph rose on the crest of passion. "Ah,
you do!" He kissed her.</p>

<p>"That's good-bye," she said. "I shall go
through it all right, Harry. You'll see no signs.
Or would you rather I went away?"</p>

<p>"What made you tell me you loved me to-night?"</p>

<p>"So many things are tormenting you, poor boy!
Must I go on doing it? Oh, I have done it, I
know. It was my self-defence. Now my self-defence
must be forgetfulness." The clock over
the stables struck a quarter past ten. "I must go
back. I've told you."</p>

<p>"Do you see Wellgood before you go to bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always."</p>

<p>"What happens?"</p>

<p>"Don't, don't, Harry! What does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to marry him?"</p>

<p>"You're going to marry Vivien! I must go&mdash;or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_308" title="pg 308"></a>
the door will be locked." A smile wavered at
him in the darkness. "It's back to the house or
into the lake!"</p>

<p>"Swear you'll manage to see me to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, anything. And&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>He let her go&mdash;without another kiss. His
mind was all of a whirl. She sped swiftly up the
avenue. He made for the gate with furtive haste.</p>

<p>Isobel came to a stop. As the shawl had gone
once, the letter had gone. Whither? Had the
wind taken it? She had heard no tread, but what
could she have heard save the beating of her own
heart? No use looking for it.</p>

<p>"Ah, miss," said the butler, who had just come
to lock up, "so you'd missed it? I saw it blowing
about, and went and picked it up. And you've
been searching for it, miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Fellowes. Thanks. I must have dropped
it this afternoon. Good-night."</p>

<p>She went in; the hall door was bolted behind
her. The letter had served its purpose, but she
was hardly awake to the fact that anything had
happened about the letter. She had told Harry!
The great secret was out. Oh, such bad tactics!
Such a dangerous thing to do! But everybody
had a breaking-point. Hers had been reached
that night&mdash;for herself as well as for his sake.
Nobody could live like this any longer.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_309" title="pg 309"></a>
Now it was good-night to Wellgood; another
ten minutes there&mdash;the one brief space of time in
which he played the lover, masterfully, roughly,
secure from interruption.</p>

<p>"I can't do it to-night!" she groaned, leaning
against the wall of the passage between drawing-room
and study, as though stricken by a failure
of the heart.</p>

<p>There she rested for minutes. The lights were
left for Wellgood to find his way by when he went
to bed; Fellowes would not come to put them
out. And there the truth came to her. She
could not play that deep-laid game. She could
no more try for Harry, and yet keep Wellgood
in reserve. It was too hard, too hideous, too
unnatural. She dared not try any more for
Harry; she had lost confidence in herself. She
could not keep Wellgood&mdash;it was too odious.
Then what to do? To tell Wellgood, too, that
from to-morrow there was only Miss Vintry?
Yes! And to try to tell Harry so again to-morrow?
Yes!</p>

<p>She had sought to make puppets and to pull
the strings. Vivien, Wellgood, Harry&mdash;all the
puppets of her cool, clever, contriving brain. It
had been a fine scheme, bound to end well for
her. Now she was revealed as a puppet herself;
she danced to the string. The great scheme
<a class="pagenum" id="page_310" title="pg 310"></a>
broke down&mdash;because Harry had looked tired and
worried, because Wellgood's rough fondness had
grown so odious.</p>

<p>"I won't go to him to-night. He can't follow
me if I go straight upstairs." The thought came
as an inspiration; at least it offered a reprieve till
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The study door opened, and Wellgood looked
out. Isobel was behind her time; he was waiting
for his secret ten minutes, his stolen interview.</p>

<p>"Isobel! What the deuce are you doing there?
Why didn't you come in?"</p>

<p>The part she had been trying to play, and had
backed herself to play, seemed to have become
this evening, of a sudden on this evening, more
than hopeless. It had turned ridiculous; it must
have been caught from some melodrama. She
had been playing the scheming dazzling villain
of a woman, heartless, with never a feeling, intent
only on the title, or the money, or the diamonds,
or whatever it might be, single in purpose, desperate
in action, glitteringly hard, glitteringly
fearless. What nonsense! How away from
human nature! She was now terribly afraid.
Playing that part, which seemed now so ridiculous
because it assumed that there was no real woman
in her, she had brought herself into a perilous
pass&mdash;between one man's love and another man's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_311" title="pg 311"></a>
wrath. She knew which she feared the more;
but she feared both. Somehow her confession
to Harry had taken all the courage out of her.
She felt as if she could not stand any more by
herself. She wanted Harry.</p>

<p>She could not tell Wellgood that henceforth
there was to be only his daughter's companion,
only Miss Vintry; she could not tell him that
to-night. Neither could she play the old part
to-night&mdash;suffer his fondness, and defend herself
with the shining weapons of her wit and her
provocative parries.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I turned faint. I was coming in,
but I turned faint. My heart, I think."</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything being the matter
with your heart." His voice sounded impatient
rather than solicitous.</p>

<p>"Please let me go straight to bed to-night.
I'm really not well."</p>

<p>He came along the passage to her. He took
her by the shoulders and looked hard in her
face. Now she summoned her old courage to
its last stand and met his gaze steadily.</p>

<p>"You look all right," he said with a sneer, yet
smiling at her handsomeness.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, yes! At least I shall be to-morrow
morning. Let me go now." Really,
at the moment, to be let go was her only desire.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_312" title="pg 312"></a>
"Be off with you, then," he said, smartly tapping&mdash;almost
slapping&mdash;her cheek. "But you'll
have to give me twice as long to-morrow."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel. With a smarting cheek
she fled down the passage.</p>

<p>Though disappointed of his ten minutes, Wellgood
was on the whole not ill-pleased. The
calm composure, the suppression of emotion which
he admired so much in theory&mdash;and as exhibited
in Vivien's companion&mdash;he had begun to find
a little overdone for his taste in his own lover.
To-night there was a softness about her, a gentleness&mdash;signs
of fear. The signs of fear were
welcome to his nature. He felt that he had
taken a step towards asserting his proper position,
and she one towards acknowledging it. He was also
more than ever sure that he need pay no heed
to Belfield's silly hints. The old fellow seemed
to assume that his precious son was irresistible!
Wellgood chuckled over that. He chuckled again
over the thought that, if Isobel were going to be
like this, they might have a difficulty in keeping
their secret till the proper time.</p>

<p>Isobel's confession to Harry was a confession
to herself also. If it left her with one great
excuse, it stripped her of all others. She could
no longer say that she was making her woman's
protest against being reckoned of no account, or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_313" title="pg 313"></a>
that she was merely punishing Harry for daring
to think that he could play with her and come
off scathless himself. Even the great excuse
found its force impaired, because she had brought
her state upon herself. Led by those impulses
of pride or of spite, she had set herself to tamper
with Vivien's happiness; in the attempt she had
fatally involved her own.</p>

<p>Some of her old courage&mdash;her old hardness&mdash;remained,
not altogether swept away by the new
current. "I shall get over it in time," she told
herself impatiently. "These things don't last a
lifetime." True, perhaps! But meanwhile&mdash;the
time before the wedding? To-morrow, when she
had promised to meet Harry? Every day after
that&mdash;when he must come to woo Vivien? There
had been protection for her in pretences. Pretences
were over with Harry; they had to go
on with Vivien and with Wellgood. On both
sides of her position she felt herself now in a sore
peril; it had become so much harder to blind
the others, so infinitely harder to hold Harry
back, if it were his mind to advance. Tasks
like these perhaps needed the zest of pride and
spite to make them possible&mdash;to make them tolerable
anyhow. She loathed them now.</p>

<p>Next day she kept her room. Courage failed.
Wellgood grumbled about women's vapours, but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_314" title="pg 314"></a>
in his caution asked no questions and showed
no concern. Harry, coming in the afternoon, in
his caution risked no more than a polite inquiry
and a polite expression of regret. Yet he had
come hot of heart, resolved&mdash;resolved on what?
To break his engagement? No, he was not
resolved on that. To know in future only
Vivien's companion, Miss Vintry? No. He
had been resolved on nothing, save to see Isobel
again, and to hear once more her love. To
what lay beyond he was blind; his heart was
obstinately set on the one desire, and had eyes
for nothing else. But Isobel was not to be seen;
he accused her of her old tactics&mdash;making advances,
then drawing back. The whole thing had begun
that way; she was at it again! Was he never to
feel quite sure of her? She paid the price of past
cunning, she who now lay in simple fear.</p>

<p>Vivien watched her lover's pale face and fretful
gestures. Harry seemed always on a strain now,
and the means he adopted to relieve it would not
be permanently beneficial to his nerves; whisky-and-soda
and cigarettes in quick succession were
his prescription this afternoon. In vain she tried
to soothe him, as she still sometimes could. He
was now merry, now moody, often amusing, gay,
gallant. He was everything except the contented
man he had been in the early days.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_315" title="pg 315"></a>
"The dear old Rector's a little tiresome, Harry,
isn't he? He won't fix the date of his return
within a week. And I couldn't be married by
anybody else, he'd be so hurt. Naturally he
doesn't think a few days one way or the other
matter. He doesn't think of my frocks!"</p>

<p>"Nor of my feelings either," said Harry, gallantly
kissing her hand.</p>

<p>"Do you mind very much?" she asked shyly.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you like about it." He
caressed her hand gently, kindly. He had at
least the grace to feel shame for himself, pity
for her&mdash;when he was with her.</p>

<p>"Harry, are you quite&mdash;quite happy?"</p>

<p>He made his effort. "I should be as happy
as the day's long if it weren't for those wretched
meetings that take up half my time." His voice
grew fretful. "And they worry me to death."</p>

<p>"They'll soon be over now, and then we can
have all the time to ourselves together." She
looked at him with a smile. "If only you won't
get tired of that!"</p>

<p>He made his protest. Suddenly a memory of
other protests swept over him&mdash;of how they had
begun by being wholehearted and vehement, and
had sunk first to weakness, then to insincerity, at
last to silence. He hoped his present protest
sounded all right.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_316" title="pg 316"></a>
"Oh, you needn't be too vehement!" she
laughed, with a little shake of her head. "I
know myself, and I believe I know more about
you than you think. I'm quite aware that you'll
sometimes be bored with me, Harry."</p>

<p>"Who's put that idea in your head?" he asked
rather sharply. His mind was on those enemies,
that ring of watching eyes.</p>

<p>"Nobody except yourself&mdash;who else should?"
she asked in surprise. "After all I've seen of
you, I ought to know that you have your moods&mdash;I
suppose clever men have&mdash;and that I don't
suit all the moods equally well." She squeezed
his hand for a second. "But I'm going to be
very wise&mdash;Isobel's taught me to be wise, among
other things, you know&mdash;I'm going to be very
wise, and not mind that!"</p>

<p>The true affection rose in him. "Poor little
sweetheart!" he murmured. "I'm afraid you
haven't taken on an easy job."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I have," she laughed. "All
the more credit if I bring it off! There'd be
nothing to be proud of in making&mdash;oh, well, Andy
Hayes, for instance&mdash;happy. He just is happy as
long as he can be working at something or walking
somewhere&mdash;it doesn't matter where&mdash;at five miles
an hour&mdash;in the dust by preference. A girl would
have nothing to do but just smile at him and send
<a class="pagenum" id="page_317" title="pg 317"></a>
him for a walk. But you're different, aren't you,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, I am! Andy's one of the best
fellows in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I think&mdash;oh, it's only my view&mdash;that
you're more interesting, Harry. Only, when you
are bored, I want you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now don't say you want me to tell you so!
Do let us be decently polite, even if I am your
husband."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I won't strain your manners so
far as that; I'm proud of their being so good
myself. No, I want you just to go away and
amuse yourself somewhere else till the fit's over.
You may even flirt just a little, if you feel it really
necessary, Harry! You needn't be quite so
religiously strict all your life as you've been
lately."</p>

<p>"Religiously strict? How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, all this time I don't believe you've
allowed yourself one good look at Isobel, though
she's very good-looking; and I know you haven't
called at the Lion yet, though Miss Flower has
been there two days, and she such an old friend of
yours in London."</p>

<p>"Have you called there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went yesterday. I like her so much,
and I like that odd friend of hers too."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_318" title="pg 318"></a>
"Oh, Sally Dutton! I suppose she got her
knife into me, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"She got her knife, as you call it, into everybody
who was mentioned. Oh yes, including
you!" Vivien laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"It's rather a bore&mdash;those girls coming down
here. I hope we shan't see too much of them."
He rose. "I'm afraid I must go, Vivien. We're
due at Medfold Crossways to-night, and it's a good
long drive, even with the motor. I've got to have
some abominable hybrid of a meal at five."</p>

<p>She too rose and came to him, putting her hands
in his. Her laughing face grew grave and tender.</p>

<p>"Dear, you really are happy?" she asked softly,
yet rather insistently.</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes; they were not veiled
or remote for him. "Honestly I believe you're
the only chance of happiness I've got in the world,
Vivien. Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"I think it's really more than being happy, or
than being sure you will be happy." She smiled.
"It gives me more to do, at all events."</p>

<p>"And if I made you unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Don't be hurt, please don't be hurt, but just
a little of that wouldn't surprise me. Oh, my
dear, you don't think I should change to you just
because of a little unhappiness? When you've
given me all the happiness I've ever had!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_319" title="pg 319"></a>
"All you've ever had? Poor child!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't quite loyal to let that slip out. And
it was my own fault, of course, mostly. But they&mdash;they
were sometimes rather hard on me." She
smiled piteously. "For my good? Perhaps it
was. Without it, you mightn't have cared for
me."</p>

<p>"Is it as much to you as that?" he asked, a
note of fear, almost of distress, in his voice.</p>

<p>She marked it, and answered gaily, "It wouldn't
be worth having if it wasn't, Harry!"</p>

<p>He kissed her fondly and tenderly, praying in
his heart that he might not turn all her happiness
to grief.</p>

<p>Her presence had wrought on him at last in its
old way; if it had not given him peace, yet it had
shown him where the chance of peace lay, if he
would take it. It had again made him hate the
thing he had been doing, and himself for doing
it; again it had made him almost hate the woman
whom and whom only he had, in truth, that day
come to see. It had made the right thing seem
again within his reach, made the idea of giving up
Vivien look both impossibly cruel to her and impossibly
foolish for himself. Yet he was, like
Isobel, in great fear&mdash;in almost hopeless fear.
These two, with their imperious desire for one
another, became, each to the other, a terror&mdash;in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_320" title="pg 320"></a>
themselves terrors, and the source of every danger
threatening from outside.</p>

<p>"She gave me the chance of ending it last night.
If only I could take her at her word!"</p>

<p>"Not after to-night!" she had said. He remembered
the words in a flash of hope. But he
remembered also that his answer had been, "Ah,
you do!" and a kiss. If she said again, "Not
after to-night!"&mdash;aye, said it again and again&mdash;would
not the answer always be, "Ah, but to-night
at least!" Such words ever promised salvation,
but brought none; they were worse than useless.
Under a specious pledge of the future, they
abandoned the present hour.</p>






<h2>Chapter XVI.<a class="pagenum" id="page_321" title="pg 321"></a></h2>

<h2>A CHOICE OF EVILS.</h2>


<p>The best parlour&mdash;the private sitting-room&mdash;at
the Lion was on the ground floor, just opposite
the private bar, and boasted a large bay window,
commanding a full view of High Street. A low
broad bench, comfortably cushioned, ran round the
window, and afforded to Miss Flower a favourable
station from which to observe what was doing in
the town. On fine days, such as ruled just now,
when the window was thrown up, the position also
served as a rendezvous to which her growing band
of friends and admirers could resort to exchange
compliments, to post her in the latest news, or
just to get a sight of her. Jack Rock would stroll
across from his shop three or four times a day;
Andy would stop a few minutes on his way to or
from his lodgings; Billy would stretch his long
legs over the sill and effect an entry; Vivien ask
if she might come in for a few minutes; Chinks
cast an eye as he hurried to his office; the Bird
<a class="pagenum" id="page_322" title="pg 322"></a>
find an incredible number of occasions for passing
on his daily duties. There the Nun sat, surveying
the traffic of Meriton, and fully aware that
Meriton, in its turn, honoured her with a flattering
attention. Within the Lion itself she already
reigned supreme; old Mr. Dove was at her feet,
so was old Cox and the other <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the private
bar; the Bird, as already hinted, was "knocked
silly"&mdash;this contemptuous phrase for a sudden
passion was Miss Miles'. Yet even Miss Miles
was affable, and quite content to avenge herself
for the Bird's desertion (which she justly
conceived to be temporary) by a marked increase
in those across-the-counter pleasantries which she
had once assured her employer were carried on
wholly and solely for the benefit of his business.
The fact was that Miss Miles had once officiated
at the bar of a "theatre of varieties," and this
constituted a professional tie between the Nun and
herself, strong enough to defy any trifling awkwardness
caused by a wavering in the Bird's
affections.</p>

<p>But the Nun's most notable and complete conquest
was over Mr. Belfield. Billy Foot had
brought him&mdash;not his son Harry&mdash;and speedily
thereafter he called on his own account, full of
courtly excuses because his wife, owing to a touch
of cold, was not with him; he hoped that she
<a class="pagenum" id="page_323" title="pg 323"></a>
would be able to come very soon. (Mr. Belfield
was engaged on another small domestic struggle,
such as had preceded Andy Hayes' first dinner at
Halton.) Serenely indifferent to the minuti&aelig; of
etiquette, Miss Flower allowed it to appear that
she would just as soon receive Mr. Belfield by
himself.</p>

<p>He interpreted her permission as applying to
more than one visit; somehow or other, most
days found him by the bay window, and generally,
on being pressed, at leisure to come in and rest.
They would chat over all manner of things together,
each imparting to the other from a store
of experiences strange to the listener; or together
they would discuss their common friends
in Meriton. She liked his shrewd and humorous
wisdom; her directness and simplicity charmed
him no less than the extreme prettiness of her
face.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Flower," he said one morning,
"the boys finish their speechifying to-morrow,
and then they'll be more at liberty to amuse you,
instead of leaving it so much to the old stagers."</p>

<p>"And then you'll all be getting busy about the
wedding. In three weeks now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Just a few days over three weeks. Individually
I shall be glad when it's over."</p>

<p>"Have they done well with their speeches?"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_324" title="pg 324"></a>
she asked. "After all my good intentions, I only
went once."</p>

<p>"They think they've made the seat absolutely
safe for Harry. Parliament and marriage&mdash;the
boy's taking on responsibilities!"</p>

<p>"It seems funny, when one's just played about
with them! It's a funny thing to be just one of
people's amusements&mdash;off the stage as well as
on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" He smiled. "Is that all you
claim to be&mdash;to any of those boys?"</p>

<p>"That's the way they look at me&mdash;in their sober
moments. Except Andy; he's quite different.
He's never been about town, you see. For him
girls and women are all in the same class."</p>

<p>"I was once about town myself," Belfield remarked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you take your son's view&mdash;and Billy
Foot's." He smiled again, and she smiled too,
meeting his glance directly. "Oh yes, Billy too&mdash;though
he may have his temptations! Squarely
now, Mr. Belfield, if&mdash;for the sake of argument&mdash;your
son treated Miss Wellgood badly, or even
Miss Vintry, it would seem a different thing from
treating Sally or me badly, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"You do put it pretty squarely," said Belfield,
twisting his lips.</p>

<p>"A glass of beer gives you the right to flirt with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_325" title="pg 325"></a>
poor Miss Miles. It's supposed to be champagne
with us. When you were about town&mdash;don't you
remember?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it was. It's not a tradition to be
proud of."</p>

<p>"There are compensations&mdash;which some of us
like. If Sally or I behave badly, who cares? But
if Miss Wellgood or Miss Vintry&mdash;! Oh, dear
me, the heavens would fall in Meriton!"</p>

<p>"By the way, I'm afraid I drive your friend
away? Miss Dutton always disappears when I call."</p>

<p>"She generally disappears when people come.
Sally's shy of strangers. Well, you know, as I
was saying, Andy Hayes hasn't got that tradition.
I think if I ever fell in love&mdash;I never do, Mr.
Belfield&mdash;I should fall in love with a man who
hadn't that tradition. But they're very hard to
find."</p>

<p>"Let's suppose it's one of those thousand things
that are going to change," he suggested, with his
sceptical smile.</p>

<p>"Do things between men and women change
much, in spite of all the talk? You've read
history, I haven't."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have to a certain extent. I don't know
that I'm inclined to give you the result of my
researches. Not very cheerful! And, meanwhile,
there's Andy Hayes!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_326" title="pg 326"></a>
"I never do it," the Nun repeated firmly.
"Besides, in this case I've not been asked. I'm
not the sort of girl he would fall in love with."</p>

<p>"Will you forgive an old man's compliment,
Miss Flower, if I say I don't know the sort of man
who wouldn't&mdash;I'll put it mildly, I'll say mightn't&mdash;fall
in love with the sort of girl you are?"</p>

<p>"I forgive it, but it's not as clever as you
generally are. Andy always wants to help. Well,
I don't want anybody to help me, you see."</p>

<p>"The delight of the eyes?" he suggested.
"What? That doesn't count? Only such as you
can afford to say so!"</p>

<p>"I don't think it counts much with Andy. He
appreciates, oh yes! He almost stared me out of
countenance the first time we met; and that's
supposed to be difficult&mdash;in London! But I
don't think it really counts for a great deal.
Andy's not a love-making man; he's emphatically
a marrying man."</p>

<p>"You draw that distinction? But the love-making
men marry?"</p>

<p>"In the end perhaps&mdash;generally rather by
accident. They haven't the instinct."</p>

<p>"You've thought about these things a good
deal, Miss Flower."</p>

<p>"I live almost entirely among men, you see,"
she answered simply. "And they show me more
<a class="pagenum" id="page_327" title="pg 327"></a>
than they show girls of&mdash;of that other class. Shall
I call again on your reminiscences?" She smiled
suddenly and brightly. "Miss Wellgood's being
awfully nice to me. She's been here twice, and
I'm going to tea at Nutley to-morrow."</p>

<p>"She's one of the dearest girls in the world,"
said Belfield. "Harry's a lucky fellow." He
glanced at the Nun. "I hope he appreciates it
properly. I believe he does."</p>

<p>She offered no comment, and a rather blank
silence followed. If Belfield had sought a reassurance,
he had not received it. On the other
hand she gave away no secrets. She, like the
silence, was blank, looking away from him, down
High Street.</p>

<p>The Bird passed the window; Jack Rock trotted
by on a young horse; one of his business equipages
clattered along not far behind him; the quiet old
street basked and dozed in the sun.</p>

<p>"What a dear rest it is&mdash;this little town!" said
the Nun softly. "Surely nothing but what's happy
and peaceful and pleasant can ever happen here?"</p>

<p>Sally Dutton came by, returning from a stroll
to which she had betaken herself on Belfield's
arrival.</p>

<p>"Well, Sally, been amusing yourself?" the
Nun called.</p>

<p>"The streets present their usual gay and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_328" title="pg 328"></a>
animated aspect," observed Miss Dutton, as she
entered the Lion.</p>

<p>"There are the two sides of the question,"
laughed Belfield. "The line between peace and
dullness&mdash;each man draws it for himself&mdash;in pencil&mdash;with
india-rubber handy! I'm really afraid
we're not amusing Miss Dutton?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she's all right. That's only her way."
She smiled reflectively; Sally always amused her.</p>

<p>Belfield rose to take leave. "We can't let
Nutley beat us," he said. "We must have you
at Halton too!" He was led into assuming that
his little domestic struggle would end in victory.</p>

<p>She looked at him, still smiling. "Wait and
see how I behave at Nutley first. If Harry gives
a good report of me&mdash;I suppose he'll be there?&mdash;ask
me to Halton!"</p>

<p>He laughed, and so let the question go. After
all, it would not do to be too sudden with his wife.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of Harry. But Wellgood's
rather a formidable character."</p>

<p>"And Miss Vintry? Is she alarming?"</p>

<p>He pursed up his lips. "I think she might be
called a little&mdash;alarming."</p>

<p>"I'll have a good look at her&mdash;and perhaps I'll
let you know what I think of her," said the Nun,
with no more than the slightest twinkle in her eyes.
It was enough for Belfield's quickness; it was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_329" title="pg 329"></a>
much more informing than the blank silence&mdash;though
even that had set him thinking.</p>

<p>But the Nun's account of her first visit to
Nutley chanced&mdash;or perhaps it was not chance&mdash;to
be rendered not to Belfield, but to Andy Hayes.
After the last meeting of the campaign, he had
gone round to smoke a pipe with Jack Rock.
Leaving him hard on midnight&mdash;there had been
much to be wormed out of Andy concerning his
speeches, their reception, the applause&mdash;he saw a
light still burning in the window at the Lion. As
he drew near, he perceived that the window was
open, and he heard a voice crooning softly. He
made bold to look in. The Nun was alone; she
sat in the window, doing nothing, singing to
herself. "Boo!" said Andy, putting his big head
in at the window.</p>

<p>"Andy!" she cried, her face lighting up.
"Jump in! You've come to scare the devils!
There are a hundred of them, and they won't go
away for all my singing. And Sally's gone to
bed, prophesying a breaking of at least six out
of the Ten Commandments! And only yesterday
I told Mr. Belfield that nothing unpleasant could
happen in Meriton! Where is one to go for quiet
if things happen in Meriton?"</p>

<p>An outburst like this was most unusual with the
Nun. It produced on Andy's face such a look of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_330" title="pg 330"></a>
mild wonder as may be seen on a St. Bernard's
when a toy-terrier barks furiously.</p>

<p>"What's happened?"</p>

<p>"I've been at Nutley."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Harry came on from there in the
car&mdash;got to the meeting rather late."</p>

<p>"Something's happened&mdash;or is happening&mdash;in
that house." She looked at him sharply. "You've
been here longer than I have&mdash;do you know
anything? Go on with your pipe."</p>

<p>Andy considered long, smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>"You do know something!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I've ground for some uneasiness," he admitted.</p>

<p>She nodded. "It was all sort of underground,"
she said. "Really most uncomfortable! They'd
try to get away from it, and yet come back to it&mdash;those
three&mdash;Mr. Wellgood, Harry, and that Miss
Vintry. Poor Vivien seemed quite outside of it
all, but somehow conscious of it&mdash;and unhappy.
She saw there was&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;antagonism,
you know. And she didn't know why. Have
you seen anything that would make Mr. Wellgood
savage if he saw it?"</p>

<p>"He didn't see what I saw."</p>

<p>"Not that time anyhow!" she amended quickly.</p>

<p>Andy frowned. "That time, I mean, of course.
If he's seen anything of that sort, or suspected it,
naturally, as Vivien Wellgood's father&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_331" title="pg 331"></a>
"Vivien's father!" Her tone was full of
impatience for his stupidity. "I suppose no
woman has ever been to Nutley lately? Oh,
Vivien's not one; she's a saint&mdash;and that's neither
male nor female. Vivien's father!"</p>

<p>"I've been there off and on," said Andy.</p>

<p>"You! Have you ever seen&mdash;not that I
suppose you'd notice it&mdash;a woman keeping two
men from one another's throats, trying to make
them think there's nothing to quarrel about, trying
to say things that one could take in one way, and
the other in the other&mdash;and third persons not take
in any way at all? Oh, it's a pretty game, and I'm
bound to say she plays it finely. But she's on
thin ice, that woman, and she knows it. Vivien's
father!"</p>

<p>"Why do you go on repeating 'Vivien's father'?"</p>

<p>"I won't." She leant forward and laid her
small hand on his arm. "Isobel Vintry's lover,
then! The man's in love with her, Andy, as sure
as we sit here. In love&mdash;and furious!"</p>

<p>"I'd never thought of that. Do you feel sure
of it?"</p>

<p>"You have thought of the other thing&mdash;and
you're sure of that?"</p>

<p>"You know Harry. I hoped it would all&mdash;all
come to nothing. How much do you think
Wellgood knows, or suspects?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_332" title="pg 332"></a>
"Hard to say. I think he's groping in the dark.
He's had a check, I expect, or a set-back. Men
always think that's due to another man&mdash;I suppose
it generally is. Well, it's not you, and it's not
Billy. Who else sees her&mdash;who else goes to
Nutley?"</p>

<p>"But he'd never suspect his own daughter's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do!"</p>

<p>"I had the evidence of my eyes."</p>

<p>"Jealousy's quicker than the eyes, Andy." She
leant forward again. "What did you see?"</p>

<p>"It seems disloyal to tell&mdash;disloyal to Harry."</p>

<p>"My loyalty's for Vivien!" she said. "What
about yours?"</p>

<p>"Take it that what I saw justifies your fears
about Harry," said Andy slowly. "I think&mdash;I'm
not sure&mdash;I think he suspects I saw. I don't
know whether she does." He was not aware that
Isobel had made herself quite certain of his knowledge.
"But it's nearly a month ago. You know
Harry. I hoped it was all over. Only he seemed
a little&mdash;queer."</p>

<p>"'Come and spend a quiet afternoon in the
garden'&mdash;that was her invitation. Poor girl!"</p>

<p>"That's what you called her the first time I told
you of their engagement."</p>

<p>"A nice quiet afternoon&mdash;sitting on the top of
a volcano! With an eruption overdue!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_333" title="pg 333"></a>
"It isn't possible to feel quite comfortable about
it, is it?" said Andy.</p>

<p>The Nun laughed a little scornfully. "Not
quite. Going to do anything about it?"</p>

<p>Andy raised his eyes to hers. "I owe almost
everything I value most in the world to Harry,
directly or indirectly; even what I owe to you and
Jack came in a way through him."</p>

<p>"And he's never taken ten minutes' real trouble
about you in his life."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that makes any difference&mdash;even
if it's true. He stands for all those things to me.
As for Miss Vintry&mdash;" He shrugged his ponderous
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, by all means to blazes with Miss Vintry!"
the Nun agreed pleasantly.</p>

<p>Miss Dutton put her head in at the door&mdash;her
hair about her shoulders. "Ever coming to bed?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I'm talking to Andy. Don't you
see him, Sally?"</p>

<p>"It's not respectable."</p>

<p>"The window's open, there's a street lamp
opposite, and a policeman standing under it.
Good-night."</p>

<p>"Well, don't come into my room and wake me
up jawing." Miss Dutton withdrew.</p>

<p>The Nun looked at Andy. "I wonder if it's
quite fair to say 'To blazes with Miss Vintry!'"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_334" title="pg 334"></a>
"You said it with a good deal of conviction a
moment ago. What makes you&mdash;?" His eyes
met hers.</p>

<p>"Who told you about Sally? I never did," the
Nun exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Harry, after our first supper."</p>

<p>"Here was rather the same case&mdash;only, of course,
she never knew the other girl. I think that makes
a difference. And she never really had a chance.
That makes no difference, I suppose. The policeman's
gone. I expect you'd better go too, Andy."</p>

<p>Andy swung his legs over the window-sill.
"Are you going to try and put your oar in?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Would you think me wrong if I did?"</p>

<p>Andy sat quite a long while on the window-sill,
dangling his legs over the pavement of High Street.</p>

<p>"I've thought about it a good deal," he answered.
"Especially lately."</p>

<p>She knelt on the broad low bench just behind
him. "Yes, and the result&mdash;when you're ready?"</p>

<p>"I think a row would be the best thing that
could happen." He turned his face round to her
as he spoke.</p>

<p>The Nun gasped. "That's thorough," she
remarked. "So much for your opinion about
Harry!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so much for that," Andy admitted.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_335" title="pg 335"></a>
"If there is a row, I hope you'll be there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't!" exclaimed Andy with a natural
and human sincerity.</p>

<p>"To prevent bloodshed!" She laid her hand
on his arm. "I'm not altogether joking. I didn't
like Mr. Wellgood's eyes this afternoon." She
patted his arm gently before she withdrew her
hand. "Good-night, dear old Andy. You're
terribly right as a rule. But about this&mdash;" She
broke off, impatiently jerking her head.</p>

<p>With a clasp of her hand and a doleful smile,
Andy let his legs drop on the pavement and
departed.</p>

<p>So that was his verdict, given with all his
deliberation, with all the weight of his leisurely
broad-viewing judgment. The real thing to
avoid was not the "row;" that was his conclusion.
There was a thing, then, worse than the "row"&mdash;the
thing for which Halton and Nutley&mdash;nay, all
Meriton, would soon be making joyful preparation.
His calm face had not moved even at her word
"bloodshed." Oh yes, Andy was thorough! Not
even that word swayed his mind. Perhaps he did
not believe in her fears. But his look had not been
scornful; it had been thoughtfully interrogative.
He had possessed that knowledge of his for a long
while; he had never used it. At first from loyalty
to Harry&mdash;even now that would, she thought, be
<a class="pagenum" id="page_336" title="pg 336"></a>
enough to make him very loth to use it. But
another reason was predominant, born of his long
silent brooding. He had come to a conclusion
about his hero; the court had taken time for
consideration; the judgment was advised. There
was no helping some people. They must be left
to their own ways, their own devices, their own
doom. To help them was to harm others; to
fight for them was to serve under the banner of
wrong and of injustice. Friendship and loyalty
could not justify that.</p>

<p>The conclusion seemed a hard one. She stood
long at the big window&mdash;a dainty little figure thrown
up by the light behind her&mdash;painfully reaching forward
to the understanding of how what seems
hardness may be a broader, a truer, a better-directed
sympathy, how it may be a duty to leave a wastrel
to waste, how not every drowning man is worth the
labour that it takes to get him out of the water&mdash;for
that once. At all events, not worth the risk of
another, a more valuable life.</p>

<p>And that was his conclusion about his hero, the
man to whom he owed, as he had said, almost
everything he prized? Had he, then, any right
to the conclusion, right in the abstract though it
might be? It was a hard world that drove men
to such hard conclusions.</p>

<p>The case was hard&mdash;and the conclusion. But
<a class="pagenum" id="page_337" title="pg 337"></a>
not, of necessity, the man who painfully arrived
at it. Yet the man might be biassed; sympathy
for the deceived might paint the deceiver's conduct
in colours even blacker than the truth demanded.
Doris did not think of this, in part because the
judgment had seemed too calm and too reluctant
to be the offspring of bias, more because, if there
were any partiality in it, she herself had become
a no less strong, and a more impetuous, adherent
of the same cause. Vivien had won all her fealty.
The one pleasant feature of the afternoon had been
when Vivien walked home with her and, wrought
upon by the troubled atmosphere of Nutley even
though ignorant of its cause, had opened her heart
to Harry's old friend, to a girl who, as she felt,
must know more of the world than she did, and
perhaps, out of her experience, could comfort and
even guide. With sweet and simple gravity, with a
delicacy that made her confidence seem still reserved
although it was well-nigh complete, she showed to
her companion her love and her apprehension&mdash;a
love so pure in quality, an apprehension based on
so rare an understanding of the man she loved.
She did not know the things he had done, nor the
thing he was now doing; but the man himself she
knew, and envisaged dimly the perils by which he
was beset. Her loving sympathy tried to leap
across the wide chasm that separated her life and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_338" title="pg 338"></a>
her nature from his, and came wonderfully little
short of its mark.</p>

<p>"I really knew hardly anything about him when
I accepted him; he was just a girl's hero to me.
But I have watched and watched, and now I know
a good deal."</p>

<p>An excellent mood for a wife, no doubt&mdash;or for
a husband&mdash;excellent, and, it may be, inevitable.
But for a lover yet unmated, a bride still to be,
a girl in her first love? Should she not leave
reverend seniors to prate to her&mdash;quite vainly&mdash;of
difficulties and dangers, while her fancy is roaming
far afield in dreamy lands of golden joy? To
endeavour, by an affectionate study of and consideration
for your partner, to avoid unhappiness
and to give comfort&mdash;such is wont to be the
text of the officiating minister's little homily at
a wedding. Is it to be supposed that bride and
bridegroom are putting the matter quite that
way in their hearts? If they were, a progressive
diminution in the marriage-rate might be expected.</p>

<p>So ran the Nun's criticism, full of sympathy
with the girl, not perhaps quite so full of sympathy
for what seemed to her an over-saintly abnegation
of her sex's right. The bitterest anti-feminist will
agree that a girl should be worshipped while she is
betrothed; he will allow her that respite of dominion
in a life which, according to his opponents, his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_339" title="pg 339"></a>
theories reduce, for all its remaining years, to
servitude. Vivien was already serving&mdash;serving
and watching anxiously&mdash;amid all her love. At
this Doris rebelled&mdash;she who never fell in love.
But she was quicker to grow fond of people than
to criticize their points of view. Vivien's over-saintliness
did sinful Harry's cause no service.
If this were Vivien's mood in the light of her
study of what her lover was, how would she
stand towards the knowledge of what he did?</p>

<p>Yet Andy Hayes thought that the best thing
now possible was that she should come to the
knowledge of it&mdash;that was what he meant by
there being a "row." That opinion of his was
a mightily strong endorsement of Vivien's anxiety.</p>

<p>"Don't you now and then feel like backing out
of it?" the Nun had asked with her usual directness.</p>

<p>Vivien's answer came with a laugh, suddenly
scornful, suddenly merry, "Why, it's all my
life!"</p>

<p>The Nun shook her sage little head; these
things were not all people's lives&mdash;oh dear, no!
She knew better than that, did Doris! But then
the foolish obstinate folk would go on believing
that they were, and thereby, for the time, made
the trouble just as great as though their delusion
were gospel truth.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_340" title="pg 340"></a>
Then Vivien had turned penitent about her
fears, and remorseful for the expression of them.
By an easy process penitence led to triumph, and
she fell to singing Harry's praises, to painting
again that brightly coloured future&mdash;the marvellous
things to be seen and done by Harry's side.
She smiled gently, rather mysteriously; the sound
of the wonderful words was echoing in her ears.
Doris saw her face, and pressed her hand in a holy
silence.</p>

<p>The result of her various conversations, of her
own reflections, and of her personal inspection of
the situation at Nutley was to throw Miss Doris
Flower into perhaps the gravest perplexity
under which she had ever suffered. When you
are accustomed to rule your life&mdash;and other
people's, on occasion&mdash;by the simple rule of doing
the obvious thing, it is disconcerting to be confronted
with a case in which there appears to be
no obvious thing to do, where there is only a
choice of evils, and the choice seems balanced
with a perverse and malicious equality. From
Vivien's side of the matter&mdash;Doris troubled herself
no more with her old friend Harry's&mdash;the marriage
was risky far beyond the average of matrimonial
risks; but the "row" was terribly risky too, with
the girl in that mood about "all her life." If
she had that mood badly upon her, she might
<a class="pagenum" id="page_341" title="pg 341"></a>
do&mdash;well, girls did do all sorts of things sometimes,
holding that life had nothing left in it.</p>

<p>Though there was nothing obvious, there must
be something sensible; at least one thing must
be more sensible than the other. Was it more
sensible to do nothing&mdash;which was to favour the
"row"&mdash;or to attempt something&mdash;which was to
work for the marriage? Her temperament asserted
itself, and led her to a conclusion in conflict with
Andy's. She was by nature inclined always to do
something. In the end the "row" was a certain
evil; the marriage only a risk. Men do settle
down&mdash;sometimes! (She wrinkled her nose as
she propounded, and qualified, this proposition.)
The risk was preferable to the certainty. After
all, her practical sense whispered, in these days
even marriage is not wholly irrevocable. Yes,
she would be for the marriage and against the
"row"&mdash;and she would tell Andy that.</p>

<p>Something was to be done then. But what?
That seemed to the Nun a much easier question&mdash;a
welcome reappearance of the obvious thing.</p>

<p>"I must find out what the woman really wants.
Until we know that, it's simply working in the
dark."</p>

<p>So she concluded, and at last turned on her side
and went to sleep.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_342" title="pg 342"></a></h2>

<h2>REFORMATION.</h2>

<p>In very truth the atmosphere at Nutley was heavy
with threatening clouds; unless a fair wind
came to scatter them, the storm must soon break.
Isobel had fled within her feminine barricades&mdash;the
barricades which women are so clever at constructing
and at persuading the conventions of life
to help them to defend. A woman's solitudes may
not be stormed; with address she can escape
private encounters. In sore fear of Harry because
sore afraid of herself, she gave him no opportunity.
In sore fear of Wellgood, she shrank from facing
him with a rupture of their secret arrangement.
Both men were tricked out of their stolen interviews&mdash;Wellgood
out of his legitimate privilege,
Harry out of his trespassing. Each asked why;
in each jealousy harked back to its one definite
starting-point&mdash;Harry's to her suggestions about
her relations with Vivien's father, Wellgood's to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_343" title="pg 343"></a>
Belfield's hints that, as a companion, Isobel was
needlessly good looking. To each of them matter
of amusement at the time when they were made,
they took on now a new significance; so irony
loves to confront our past and present moods.
But Wellgood held a card that was not in Harry's
hand&mdash;a card which could not win the game, but
could at least secure an opening. He was employer
as well as lover. Vivien's father could
command the presence of Vivien's companion&mdash;not
indeed late at night, for that would be a
scarcely judicious straining of his powers, but at
any reputable business-transacting hour of the day.
For two nights&mdash;and that day of which the Nun
had been a witness&mdash;he suffered the evasion of his
rights; then, with a suavity dangerous in a man
so rough, he prayed Miss Vintry's presence in the
study for ten minutes (the established period!)
before dinner; there were ways and means to be
discussed, he said, matters touching the <i>trousseau</i>
and the wedding entertainment. Vivien was
bidden to run away and dress. "We're preparing
one or two surprises for you, my dear," he
said to her, with a grim smile which carried for
Isobel a hidden reference.</p>

<p>Thus commanded in Vivien's presence, Isobel
was cleverly caught between the duty of obedience
and the abandonment of her ostensible position in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_344" title="pg 344"></a>
the house. Her barricade was being outflanked;
she was forced into the open.</p>

<p>She was in fear of him, almost actual physical
fear; whether more of his fondness or of his
roughness she could not tell; she felt that she
could hardly bear either. Since her avowal to
Harry, her courage had never returned, her
weapons seemed blunted, she was no more mistress
of all her resources. Yet in the end she feared the
fondness more, and would at all costs avoid that.
She summoned the remnants of her once brilliant
array of bravery.</p>

<p>Alone with her, he wasted no time on the artifice
which had secured him privacy.</p>

<p>"What's this new fad, Isobel? You're wilfully
avoiding me. One evening you turn faint; another
you dodge me, and are off to bed! Though I
don't think I've ever made exacting claims on your
time, considering!"</p>

<p>"I've been afraid&mdash;you'd better hear the truth&mdash;to
speak to you."</p>

<p>"I should like the truth, certainly, if I can get
it. What have you been afraid to speak to me
about?"</p>

<p>"Our engagement." She made the plunge, her
eyes fixed apprehensively on his face. "I&mdash;I can't
go on with it, Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>He had schooled himself for this answer; he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_345" title="pg 345"></a>
made no outburst. His tone was mild; the
cunning of jealousy gave him an alien smoothness.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my dear, and tell me why."</p>

<p>She sat facing him, his writing-table between
them.</p>

<p>"My feelings haven't&mdash;haven't developed as I
hoped they would."</p>

<p>"Oh, your feelings haven't developed?" he
repeated slowly. "Towards me?"</p>

<p>"I reserved the right to change my mind&mdash;you
remember?"</p>

<p>"And I the right to be unpleasant about it."
He smiled under intent eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the house to-morrow, if you like,"
she cried, eager now to accept a banishment she
had once dreaded.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I'm not going to be unpleasant.
We needn't do things like that."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I should prefer it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you should feel that. There's no
need; you shan't be annoyed."</p>

<p>"That's good of you. I thought you'd be
very, very hard to me."</p>

<p>"Would that be the best way to win you back?
I don't know&mdash;at any rate I don't feel like following
it. But really you can't go off at a moment's
notice&mdash;and just now! What would Vivien think?
What are we to say to her? What would everybody
<a class="pagenum" id="page_346" title="pg 346"></a>
think? And how are Vivien and I to get
through all this business of the wedding?"</p>

<p>"I know it would be awkward, and look odd,
but it might be better. Your feelings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind my feelings; you know they're
not my weak spot. Come, Isobel, you see now
you've no cause to be afraid of me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You're behaving very kindly&mdash;more kindly
than perhaps I could expect." Down in her
mind there was latent distrust of this unwonted
uncharacteristic kindness. Yet it looked genuine
enough. There was no reference to the name she
dreaded; no hint, no sneer, about Harry Belfield.
She rose to a hope that her tricks and her fencing
had been successful, that he was quite in the dark,
that the issue was to his mind between their two
selves alone, with no intruder.</p>

<p>Wellgood's jealousy bade him be proud of his
effort, and encouraged him to persevere. The
natural temper of the man might be raging, almost
to the laying of hands on her; it must be kept
down; the time for it was not yet. Rudeness or
roughness would give her an excuse for flight; he
would not have her fly. A plausible kindness, a
considerate smoothness&mdash;that was the card jealousy
selected for him to play.</p>

<p>"You shan't be troubled, you shan't be annoyed.
I'll give up my evening treat. We'll go back to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_347" title="pg 347"></a>
our old footing&mdash;before I spoke to you about this.
I'll ask nothing of you as a lover&mdash;well, except not
to decide finally against me till the wedding.
Only three weeks! But as my friend, and
Vivien's, I do ask you not to leave us in the lurch
now&mdash;at this particular moment&mdash;and not to risk
setting everybody talking. If you insist on leaving
me, go after the wedding. That means no
change in our plan, except that you won't come
back. That'll seem quite natural; it's what they
all expect."</p>

<p>Still never a word of Harry, no hint of resentment,
nothing that could alarm her or give her a
handle for offence! Whether from friend or lover,
his request sounded most moderate and reasonable.
Not to leave the friend in the lurch, not to decide
with harsh haste against a patient lover who had
been given cause for confident hope, almost for
certainty! He left her no plausible answer, for
she could adduce no grievance against him. He
had but taken what for her own purposes she had
been content to allow&mdash;first in his bluff flirtation,
then in his ill-restrained endearments. There was
no plausibility in turning round and pretending
to resent these things now. She dared not take
false points in an encounter so perilous; that
would be to expose herself to a crushing reply.</p>

<p>"If you go now&mdash;all of a sudden, at this
<a class="pagenum" id="page_348" title="pg 348"></a>
moment&mdash;I can't help thinking you'll put yourself
under a slur, or else put me under one. People
know the position you've been in here&mdash;practically
mistress of the house, with Vivien in your entire
charge. Very queer to leave three weeks before
her wedding! You may invent excuses, or we
may. An aunt dying&mdash;something of that sort!
Nobody ever believes in those dying aunts!"</p>

<p>It was all true; people did not believe in those
dying aunts, not when sudden departures of handsome
young women were in question. People
would talk; the thing would look odd. His
plausible cunning left her no loophole.</p>

<p>"If you wish it, I'll stay till the wedding, on
our old footing&mdash;as we were before all this, I
mean. But you mustn't think there's any chance
of my&mdash;my changing again."</p>

<p>"Thank you." He put out his hand across the
table. She could not but take it. Though he
seemed so cool and quiet, the hand was very hot.
He held hers for a long while, his eyes intently
fixed on her in a regard which she could not
fathom, but which filled her anew with fear. She
fell into a tremble; her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Let me go now, please," she entreated, her
eyes unable to meet his any longer.</p>

<p>He released her hand, and leant back in his
chair. He smiled at her again, as he said, "Yes,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_349" title="pg 349"></a>
go now. I'm afraid this interview has been rather
trying to you&mdash;perhaps to us both."</p>

<p>Of all the passions, the sufferings, the undergoings
of mankind, none has so relentlessly been
put to run the gauntlet of ridicule as jealousy. It
is the sport of the composer of light verses, the
born material of the writer of farce&mdash;especially
when it is well founded. It is perhaps strange to
remark&mdash;could any strangeness outlast familiarity&mdash;that
the supreme study of it treats of it as utterly
unfounded, and finds its highest tragedy in its
baselessness. Ridiculous when justifiable, tragic
when all a delusion! Is that nature's view, even
as it is so often art's? Certainly the race is
obstinate in holding real failure in the conflict
of sex as small recommendation in a hero,
imagined as the opportunity for his highest effect.
King Arthur hardly bears the burden of being
deceived; on the baseless suspicion of it the
Moor rides through murder to a triumphant death&mdash;and
a general sympathy&mdash;unless nowadays
women have anything to say on the latter point.</p>

<p>Yet this poor passion&mdash;commonly so ridiculous,
even more commonly, among the polite, held ill-bred&mdash;must
be allowed its features of interest.
It is remarkably alert, acute, ingenious, even
laborious, in its sweeping of details into its net.
It works up its brief very industriously, be the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_350" title="pg 350"></a>
instructions never so meagre&mdash;somehow it invites
legal metaphor, being always plaintiff in the court
of sex, always with its grievance to prove, generally
faced with singularly hard swearing in the witness
box. It has its successes, as witnessed by notable
phrases; there is the "unwritten law," and there
are "extenuating circumstances." The phrases
throw back a rather startling illumination on the
sport of versifiers and the material of farce. But
the exceptional cases have a trick of stamping
themselves on phraseology. Most of us are
jealous with no very momentous results. We
grumble a little, watch a little, sulk a little, and
decide that there is nothing in it. Often there is
not. Likewise we are ambitious without convulsing
the world&mdash;or even our own family circle. So
with our lives, our loves, our deaths&mdash;history,
poetry, elegy find no place for them. Only
nature has and keeps a mother's love for the
ordinary man, and holds his doings legitimate
matter for her interest, nay, essential to her eternal
unresting plan. She may be figured as investing
the bulk of her fortune in him, as in three per
cents.&mdash;genius being her occasional "flutter."</p>

<p>Mark Wellgood was an ordinary man, and he
was proud of the fact; that must, perhaps, be
considered a circumstance of aggravation. He
refused the suggestions of civilization to modify,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_351" title="pg 351"></a>
and of sentiment to soften, his primitive instincts;
he was proud of them just as they were. If any
man had come between him and his woman&mdash;primitive
also were the terms his thoughts used&mdash;that
man should pay for it. If there were any
man at all, who could it be but Harry Belfield?
If it were Harry Belfield, Wellgood refused to
hold him innocent of an inkling of how matters
stood between Isobel and Vivien's father&mdash;he must
have pretty nearly guessed, even if she had not
told him. At least there were relations between
Vivien herself and the suspected trespasser. Did
they not give cause enough for a father's anger,
deep and righteous, demanding vengeance? They
gave cause&mdash;and they gave cover. The jealous
suitor could use the indignant father's plea, the
indignant father's weapons. The lover's revenge
would make the father's duty sweet. He was not
indifferent to the wrong done to Vivien; yet he
almost prized it for the advantage it gave him in
his own quarrel. It was not often that jealousy
could plume itself on so honourable and so useful
an ally!</p>

<p>Single-hearted concern for Vivien would have
let Isobel go, as she prayed, and given Harry
either his dismissal or the chance to mend his
ways in the absence of temptation. Jealousy
imperiously vetoed such suggestions. Isobel
<a class="pagenum" id="page_352" title="pg 352"></a>
should not go. Harry should neither be dismissed
nor given a fair chance and a fresh start.
If he could, Wellgood would still keep Isobel;
at least he would punish Harry, if he caught him.
For the sake of these things he compromised his
daughter's cause, and made her an instrument for
his own purposes. And he did this with no sense
of wrong-doing. So masterful was his self-regarding
passion that his daughter's claim fell to the
status of his pretext.</p>

<p>So he smoothed his face and watched.</p>

<p>But Isobel too was now on the alert. She was
no longer merely resolved that she would behave
herself because she ought; she saw that perforce
she must. At least, no more secret dealings!
Harry must be told that. The hidden hope that
his answer would be, "Open dealings, then, at any
cost," beat still in her heart, faintly, yet without
ceasing. But if that answer came not, then all
must be over. Word must go to him of that
before he next came to Nutley. Such consolation
as lay in knowing that she would not marry Wellgood
should be his also. Then, perhaps, things
would go a little easier, and these terrible three
weeks slip past without disaster. Terrible&mdash;yes;
but, alas, the end of them seemed more terrible yet.</p>

<p>Even had the post seemed safe, there was none
which could reach Harry before he was due at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_353" title="pg 353"></a>
Nutley again. She had to find a messenger. She
decided on Andy Hayes. He was a safe man; he
would not forget to fulfil his charge. The very
fact of that bit of knowledge he possessed made
him in her eyes the safest messenger; if he had
not talked about that other thing, he was not
likely to talk about the letter; unlikely to mention
it in malice, certain not to refer to it in
innocence or inadvertence. And she knew where
to find him. Andy had, with Wellgood's permission,
resumed his practice of bathing before
breakfast in Nutley lake. The stripes of his
bathing-suit were a familiar object to her as he
emerged from the bushes or plunged into the
water; from her window she could watch his
powerful strokes. His hour was half-past seven;
before eight nobody but servants would be about.</p>

<p>Andy, then, emerging from the shrubbery dressed
after his dip, found Miss Vintry strolling up and
down.</p>

<p>"You're surprised to see me out so early, Mr.
Hayes? But I know your habits. My window
looks out this way."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully careful to keep well hidden in the
bushes."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" she laughed. "I've not come to
warn you off. Are you likely to see Mr. Harry
this morning?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_354" title="pg 354"></a>
"I easily can; I shall be passing Halton."</p>

<p>"I specially want this note to reach him early
in the morning. It's rather important. I should
be so much obliged if you'd take it; and will you
give it to him yourself?"</p>

<p>Andy stood silent for a moment, not offering to
take the letter from her hand. She had foreseen
that he might hesitate, knowing what he did; she
had even thought that his hesitation might give
her an opportunity. Feigning to notice nothing
in his manner, she went on, "I must add that I
shall be glad if you'll give it to him when he's
alone, and if you won't mention it. It relates to
a private matter."</p>

<p>Andy spoke slowly. "I'm not sure you'd
choose me to carry it if you knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do know; at least I never had much
doubt, and I've had none since a talk we had
together at Halton. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything about it then, did I?"
asked Andy.</p>

<p>She smiled. "Not in so many words. You
saw a great piece of foolishness&mdash;the first and
last, I need hardly tell you. I'm very much
ashamed of it. In that letter I ask Mr. Harry
to forget all about it, and to remember only
that I am, and want to go on being, Vivien's
friend."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_355" title="pg 355"></a>
It sounded well, but Andy was not quite convinced.</p>

<p>"It's some time ago now. Mightn't you just
ignore it?"</p>

<p>"As far as he's concerned, no doubt I might;
but I rather want to get it off my own conscience,
Mr. Hayes. It'll make me happier in meeting
him. I shall be happier in meeting you too,
after this little talk. Somehow that wretched bit
of silliness seems to have made an awkwardness
between us, and I want to leave Nutley good
friends with every one."</p>

<p>She sounded very sincere; nay, in a sense she
was sincere. She was ashamed; she did want to
end the whole matter&mdash;unless that unexpected
answer came. At any rate she was&mdash;or sounded&mdash;sincere
enough to make Andy hold out his hand
for the letter.</p>

<p>"I'll take it and give it to him as you wish,
Miss Vintry. I'm bound to say, though, that, if
apologies are being made, I think Harry's the one
to make them."</p>

<p>"We women are taught to think such things
worse in ourselves than in men. Men get carried
away; they're allowed to, now and then. We
mustn't."</p>

<p>The appeal to his chivalry&mdash;another wrong to
woman!&mdash;touched Andy. "That's infernally unfair!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_356" title="pg 356"></a>
"It sometimes seems so, just a little. I'm
sincerely grateful to you, Mr. Hayes." She held
out her hand to him. "You won't think it necessary
to mention to Mr. Harry all I've told you?
I don't think he was so sure as I was about&mdash;about
your presence. And somehow it makes it seem
worse if he knew that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall say nothing whatever, if he doesn't,"
said Andy, as he shook hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you again. I don't think I dare risk
asking you to be friends&mdash;real friends&mdash;yet; but
I may, perhaps, on the wedding day."</p>

<p>"I've never been your enemy, Miss Vintry."</p>

<p>"No; you've been kind, considerate"&mdash;her
voice dropped&mdash;"merciful. Thank you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She left Andy with her letter in his hands, and
her humble thanks echoing in his ears&mdash;words
that, in thanking him for his silence, bound him
to a continuance of it. Andy felt most of the
guilt suddenly transferred to his shoulders, because
he had told the Nun&mdash;well, very nearly all about
it! That could not be helped now. After all, it
was Miss Vintry's own fault; she should have
done sooner what she had done now. "All the
same," thought chivalrous Andy, "I might give
Doris a hint that things look a good bit better."</p>

<p>Certainly Isobel Vintry had cause to congratulate
<a class="pagenum" id="page_357" title="pg 357"></a>
herself on a useful morning's work&mdash;Harry safely
warned, Andy in great measure conciliated. She
felt more able to face Wellgood over the teapot.</p>

<p>The first round had gone in her favour; the
zone of danger was appreciably contracted. Her
courage rose; her conscience, too, was quieter.
She felt comparatively honest. With Wellgood
she had gone as near to absolute honesty as the
circumstances permitted. She had broken the
engagement; she had even prayed to be allowed
to go away, with all that meant to her. Wellgood
made her stay. Then, so far as he was concerned,
the issue must be on his own head. If that unexpected
answer should come in the course of the
weeks still left for it, it would be Wellgood's own
lookout. As for Vivien&mdash;well, she was perceptibly
more honest even in regard to Vivien. If she
fought still, in desperate hope, for Vivien's lover,
she fought now in fairer fashion, by refusing, not
by accepting, his society, his attentions, his kisses.
She would be nothing to him unless he found
himself forced to cry, "Be everything!" She
would abide no longer on that half-way ground;
there were to be no more sly tricks and secret
meetings. The kisses, if kisses came, would
not be stolen, but ravished in conquest from
a rival's lips. If sin, that was sin in the grand
manner.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_358" title="pg 358"></a>
At lunch-time a note came for Vivien, brought
by a groom on a bicycle.</p>

<p>"Oh, from Harry!" she exclaimed, tearing it
open.</p>

<p>Isobel, sitting opposite Wellgood, set her face.
She had expected a note to come for Vivien from
Harry. She was on her mettle, fighting warily,
risking no points. No note should come to her
from Harry, to be opened perhaps under Wellgood's
eyes; he had been known to ask to see
letters, in his matter-of-course way assuming that
there could be nothing private in them. Harry's
answer to the note Andy delivered was to come
to Isobel through Vivien, and to come in terms
dictated by Isobel, terms that she alone would
understand. She could always contrive to see
Vivien's letters; generally they were left about.</p>

<p>"He's so sorry he can't bring Mr. Foot to
tennis with him this afternoon; they're going to
play golf," Vivien announced, rather disappointed.
But she cheered up. "Oh well, it's rather hot for
tennis; and I shall see him to-night, at dinner at
Halton."</p>

<p>"Does he say anything else?" asked Isobel
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Only that he's bored to death with politics."
She laughed. "What's worrying him, I wonder?"</p>

<p>For a moment Isobel sat with eyes lowered;
<a class="pagenum" id="page_359" title="pg 359"></a>
then she raised them and looked across to Wellgood.
He was not looking at her; he was carving
beef. Then it did not matter if her face had
changed a little when she heard that Harry was
bored with politics. Neither Wellgood nor Vivien
had seen any change there might possibly have
been in her face.</p>

<p>That trivial observation about politics was the
answer&mdash;the expected answer, not that unexpected
one. It meant, "I accept your decision."</p>

<p>Oddly enough her first feeling, the one that rose
instinctively in her mind, was of triumph over
Wellgood. Had she expressed it with the primitive
simplicity on which he prided himself, she
would have cried, "Sold again!" She had got
out of her great peril; she had settled the whole
thing. He had not scored a single point against
her. She had regained her independence of him,
and without cost. There was no longer anything
for him to discover. He had no more rights over
her; he had to renew his wooing, again to court,
to conciliate. He had no way of finding out the
past; Andy Hayes was safe. The future was
again in her hands. Her smile at Wellgood was
serene and confident. She was retreating in perfect
order, after fighting a brilliantly successful
rearguard action.</p>

<p>Even of the retreat itself she was, for the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_360" title="pg 360"></a>
moment at least, half glad. Fear and longing
had so mingled in her dreams of that unexpected
answer. To be free from that crisis and that
revelation! They would have meant flight for her,
pursued by a chorus of condemning voices. They
would have meant at least days, perhaps weeks, of
straining vigilance, of harrowing suspense&mdash;never
sure of her ground, never sure of herself; above
all, never sure of Harry. Who, if not she, should
know that you never could be sure of Harry?
Who, if not she, should know that neither his
plighted word nor his hottest impulse could be
relied upon to last? Yes, she was&mdash;half glad;
almost more than half glad, when she looked at
Vivien. In the back of her mind, save maybe
when passion ran at full flood for those rare
minutes, the stolen ten that had come for so few
days, had been the feeling that it would be a
terrible thing to be&mdash;to be "shown up" to Vivien.
The sage adviser, the firm preceptress, the model
of the virtues of self-control&mdash;how would she have
looked in the eyes of Vivien, even had the open,
the triumphant victory come to pass? Really that
hardly bore thinking of, if she had still any self-respect
to lose.</p>

<p>She walked alone in the drive after lunch&mdash;where
she had been wont to meet him. Let it all
go! At least it had done one thing for her&mdash;it had
<a class="pagenum" id="page_361" title="pg 361"></a>
saved her from Wellgood. It had taught her love,
and made the pretence of love impossible&mdash;the
suffering of unwelcome caresses a thing unholy.
Then it was not all to the bad? It left her with a
dream, a vision, a thing unrealized yet real; something
to take with her into that new, cold, unknown
world of strange people into which, for a livelihood's
sake, she must soon plunge&mdash;must plunge
as soon as she had seen Harry married to Vivien!</p>

<p>The sun was on the lake that afternoon; the
water looked peaceful, friendly, consoling. She sat
down by the margin of it, and gave herself to
memories. They came thick and fast, repeating
themselves endlessly out of scant material&mdash;full of
shame, full of woe; but also full of triumph, for
she had been loved&mdash;at least for the time desired&mdash;by
the man of her love and desire. Bought at a
great cost? Yes. And never ought to have been
bought? No. But now by no means to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>She was alone; everything was still, in the calm
of a September afternoon. She bowed her head to
her hands and wept.</p>

<p>The Nun walked up the drive and saw the figure
of a woman weeping.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_362" title="pg 362"></a></h2>

<h2>PENITENCE AND PROBLEMS.</h2>

<p>The Nun stopped, walked on a few paces, came
to a stand again. She was visiting Nutley
in pursuance of her plan of doing, if not that
undiscoverable obvious, yet the more sensible
thing&mdash;of preventing the "row" and, incidentally
thereto, of finding out "what the woman really
wanted."</p>

<p>Here was the woman. Whatever she might
really want, apparently she was very far from having
got it yet. She also looked very different from
the adversary with whom Miss Flower had pictured
herself as conducting a contest of wits&mdash;quite unlike
the cool, wary, dexterous woman who had
played her difficult game between the two men
so finely, and who might be trusted to treat her
opponent to a very pretty display of fencing. The
position seemed so changed that the Nun had
thoughts of going back. To discover a new, and
what one has considered rather a hostile, acquaintance
<a class="pagenum" id="page_363" title="pg 363"></a>
in tears is embarrassing; and the acquaintance
may well share the embarrassment.</p>

<p>Fortunately Isobel stopped crying. She dried
her eyes and tucked away her handkerchief. The
Nun advanced again. Isobel sat looking drearily
over the lake.</p>

<p>"Dropped your sixpence in the pond, Miss
Vintry?" the Nun asked.</p>

<p>Isobel turned round sharply.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I mean&mdash;you're not looking very
cheerful."</p>

<p>Isobel's eyes hardened a little.</p>

<p>"Have you been there long?"</p>

<p>"I saw you were crying, if that's what you mean.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. People should cry
in their own rooms if they want to keep it quiet."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind; it doesn't matter whether
you saw or not. Every woman is entitled to cry
sometimes."</p>

<p>"I don't cry myself," observed the Nun, "but
of course a great many girls do."</p>

<p>"I daresay I shouldn't cry if I were the great
Miss Doris Flower."</p>

<p>The Nun gurgled. That ebullition could usually
be brought about by any reference to the greatness
of her position, not precisely because the position
was not great&mdash;rather because it was funny that it
should be. She sat down beside Isobel.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_364" title="pg 364"></a>
"Please don't tell Vivien what you saw. I don't
want her to know I've been crying. She's remorseful
enough as it is about her marriage costing me
my 'place.'"</p>

<p>"Was that what you were crying about?"</p>

<p>"It seems silly, doesn't it? But I've been
happy here, and&mdash;and they've got fond of me.
And finding a new one&mdash;well, it seems like plunging
into this lake on a cold day. So quite suddenly
I got terribly dreary."</p>

<p>"Well, you've had it out, haven't you?" suggested
the Nun consolingly.</p>

<p>"Yes; and much good it's done to the situation!"
laughed Isobel ruefully. "Oh, well, I suppose
my feelings are the situation&mdash;at any rate there's
no other."</p>

<p>"Then if you feel better, things are better
too."</p>

<p>The Nun did not feel that she was getting on
much with the secret object of her visit; she even
felt the impulse to get on with it weakened. She
was more inclined just to have a friendly, a consoling
chat. However business was business. To
get on she must take a little risk. She dug the
earth on the edge of the pond with the point of her
sunshade and observed carelessly, "If you very
particularly wanted to stay at Nutley, I should
have thought you might have the chance."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_365" title="pg 365"></a>
"Oh, are people gossiping about that? Poor
Mr. Wellgood!"</p>

<p>"It was the observation of my own eyes," said
the Nun sedately. "Oh, of course you can deny
it if you like, though I don't see why you should&mdash;and
I shan't believe you."</p>

<p>"If you've such confidence in your own eyes as
that, Miss Flower, it would be wasting my breath
to try to convince you. Have it your own way.
But even that would be&mdash;a new place. And I've
told you that I'm afraid of new places."</p>

<p>"All plunges aren't into cold water," the Nun
observed reflectively.</p>

<p>"That one would be colder, I think, than a
quite strange plunge&mdash;away from Nutley."</p>

<p>"It's a great pity we're not built so as to fall in
love conveniently. It would have been so nice for
you to stay&mdash;in the new place."</p>

<p>"I'm only letting you have it your own way,
Miss Flower. I've admitted nothing."</p>

<p>"All that appears at present is that you needn't
go if you don't like&mdash;and yet you cry about
going!"</p>

<p>Isobel smiled.</p>

<p>"I might cry at leaving all my friends, especially
at leaving Vivien, without wanting to stop&mdash;with
Mr. Wellgood, as you insist on having it. Is that
comprehensible?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_366" title="pg 366"></a>
"Well, I expect I've asked enough questions,"
said the cunning Nun, wondering hard how she
could contrive to ask another&mdash;and get an answer
to it. "But in Meriton there's nothing to do but
gossip to and about one's friends. That's what
makes it so jolly. Why, this wedding is simply
occupation for all of us! What shall we do when
it's over? Oh, well, I shall be gone, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And so shall I&mdash;so we needn't trouble about
that."</p>

<p>The Nun was baffled. A strange impassivity
seemed to fall on her companion the moment that
the talk was of Harry's wedding. She tried once
again.</p>

<p>"I do hope it'll turn out well."</p>

<p>Isobel offered no comment whatever. In truth
she was not sure of herself; her agitation was too
recent and had been too violent&mdash;it might return.</p>

<p>"I've known Harry for so long&mdash;and I like
Miss Wellgood so much." She gave as interrogative
a note as she could to her remarks&mdash;without
asking direct questions. "I think he really is
in love at last!" Surely, that ought to draw some
question or remark&mdash;that "at last"? It drew
nothing. "But&mdash;well, we used to say one never
knew with poor Harry!" ("Further than that,"
thought the Nun, "without telling tales, I cannot
go.")</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_367" title="pg 367"></a>
Isobel sat silent.</p>

<p>The result was meagre. Isobel would talk
about Wellgood, evasively but without embarrassment;
references to Harry Belfield reduced her to
silence. It was a little new light on the past; its
bearing on the future, if any, was negative. She
would not, it seemed, stay at Nutley with Wellgood.
She would not talk of Harry. She had
been crying. The crying was the satisfactory
feature in the case.</p>

<p>The Nun rose.</p>

<p>"I must go in and see Miss Wellgood."</p>

<p>"She's gone out with her father, I'm afraid.
That's how I happen to be off duty."</p>

<p>"And able to cry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you'll forget that nonsense. I'm
quite resigned to everything, really." She too
rose, smiling at her companion. "Only I rather
wish it was all over&mdash;and the plunge made!"</p>

<p>The Nun reported the fact of her interview&mdash;and
the results, such as they were&mdash;to Miss Dutton
when she returned home.</p>

<p>"Her crying shows that she doesn't think she's
got much chance," said the Nun hopefully.</p>

<p>"It shows she'd take a chance, if she got one,"
Miss Dutton opined acutely.</p>

<p>"You mean it all depends on Harry, then?"</p>

<p>"In my opinion it always has."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_368" title="pg 368"></a>
That indeed seemed the net result. It all depended
on Harry&mdash;not at first sight a very satisfactory
conclusion for those who knew Harry.
However, Andy, who came into the Lion later in
the afternoon, was hopeful&mdash;nay, confident. He
had mysterious reasons for this frame of mind&mdash;information
which he declared himself unable to
disclose; he could not even indicate the source
from which it proceeded, but he might say that
there were two sources. He really could not say
more&mdash;which annoyed the Nun extremely.</p>

<p>"But I think we may consider all the trouble
over," he ended.</p>

<p>For had not Harry, when he got his note, dealt
quite frankly with Andy&mdash;well, with very considerable
frankness as to the past, with complete as to
the future? He admitted that he had "more or
less made a fool of himself," but declared that it
had been mere nonsense, and was altogether over.
Absolutely done with! He gave Andy his hand
on that, begged his pardon for having been sulky
with him, and told him that henceforward all his
thoughts would be where his heart had been all
through&mdash;with Vivien. If Isobel had convinced
Andy, Harry convinced him ten times more.
Andy had such a habit of believing people. He
was not, indeed, easily or stupidly deceived by a
wilful liar; but he fell a victim to people who
<a class="pagenum" id="page_369" title="pg 369"></a>
believed in themselves, who thought they were
telling the truth. It was so hard for him to understand
that people would not go on feeling and
meaning what they were sincerely feeling and
meaning at the moment. They could convince
him, if only they were convinced themselves.</p>

<p>"Let's think no more about it, and then we can
all be happy," he said to the Nun. It really made
a great difference to his happiness how Harry was
behaving.</p>

<p>After all, it was rather hard&mdash;and rather hard-hearted&mdash;not
to believe in Harry, when Harry
believed so thoroughly in himself. The strongest
proof of his regained self-confidence was the visit
he paid to the Nun&mdash;a visit long overdue in
friendship and even in courtesy. Harry asked for
no forgiveness; he seemed to assume that she
would understand how, having been troubled in
his mind of late, he had not been in the mood
for visits. He was quite his old self when he
came, so much his old self that he scarcely cared
to disguise the fact that he had given some cause
for anxiety&mdash;any more than he expected to be met
with doubt when he implied that all cause for
anxiety was past. He had quite got over that
attack, and his constitution was really the stronger
for it. Illnesses are nature's curative processes, so
the doctors tell us. Harry was always more
<a class="pagenum" id="page_370" title="pg 370"></a>
virtuous after a moral seizure. The seizure being
the effective cause of his improvement, he could
not be expected to regard it with unmixed regret.
If, incidentally, it witnessed to his conquering
charms, he could not help that. Of course he
would not talk about the thing; he did not so
much mind other people implying, assuming, or
hinting at it.</p>

<p>If the Nun obliged him at all in this way, she
chose the difficult method of irony&mdash;in which not
her greatest admirer could claim that she was very
subtle.</p>

<p>"My dear Harry, I quite understand your not
calling. How could you think of me when you
were quite wrapped up in Vivien Wellgood? I
was really glad!"</p>

<p>Now that Harry had come, he found himself
delighted with his visit.</p>

<p>"Country air's agreeing with you, Doris. You
look splendid." His eyes spoke undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Harry. I know you thought me
good-looking once." The Nun was meek and
grateful.</p>

<p>Harry laughed, by no means resenting the
allusion. That had been an illness, a curative
process, also&mdash;though her curative measures had
been rather too summary for his taste.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_371" title="pg 371"></a>
"Whose peace of mind are you destroying down
here?"</p>

<p>"I've a right to destroy peace of mind if I want
to. It's not as if I were engaged to be married&mdash;as
you are. I think Jack Rock's in most danger&mdash;or
perhaps your father."</p>

<p>"The pater inherits some of my weaknesses,"
said Harry. "Or shares my tastes, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he's devoted to Vivien."</p>

<p>"You never look prettier than when you're
trying to say nasty things."</p>

<p>"I'll stop, or in another moment you'll be
offering to kiss me."</p>

<p>"Should you object?"</p>

<p>"Hardly worth while. It would mean nothing
at all to either of us. Still&mdash;I'm not a poacher."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to me to be able to take a joke
either." Harry's voice sounded annoyed. "But
we won't quarrel. I've been through one of my
fits of the blues, Doris. Don't be hard on a
fellow."</p>

<p>"It would be so much better for you if people
could be hard on you, Harry. Still you'll have
to pay for it somehow. We all have to pay for
being what we are&mdash;somehow. Perhaps you won't
know you're paying&mdash;you'll call it by some other
name; perhaps you won't care. But you'll have
to pay somehow."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_372" title="pg 372"></a>
The Nun made a queer figure of a moralist;
she was really far too pretty. But her words got
home to Harry&mdash;the new, the recovered, Harry.</p>

<p>"I have paid," he said. "Oh yes, you don't
believe it, but I have! The bill's paid, and receipted.
I'm starting fair now. But you never
did do me justice."</p>

<p>"I've always done justice to what you care most
about&mdash;Harry the Irresistible!"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop that rot!" he implored. "I'm
serious, you know, Doris."</p>

<p>"I know all the symptoms of your seriousness.
The first is wanting to flirt with somebody fresh."</p>

<p>Harry's laugh was vexed&mdash;but not of bitter
vexation. "Give a fellow a chance!"</p>

<p>"The whole world's in league to do it&mdash;again
and again!"</p>

<p>"This time the world is going to find me
appreciative. You don't know what a splendid
girl Vivien is! If you did, you'd understand
how&mdash;how&mdash;well, how things look different."</p>

<p>The Nun relented. "I really think it may last
you over the wedding&mdash;and perhaps the honeymoon,"
she said.</p>

<p>The extraordinary thing to her&mdash;indeed to all
his friends who did not share his most mercurial
temperament&mdash;was that this change of mood was
entirely sincere in Harry, and his satisfaction with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_373" title="pg 373"></a>
it not less genuine. For two painful hours&mdash;from
his receipt of Isobel's note to his dispatching of
that sentence about being bored with politics&mdash;he
had struggled, keeping Andy in an adjoining
room solaced by newspapers and tobacco, in case
counsel should be needed. Then the right had
won&mdash;and all was over! When all was over, it
was with Harry exactly as if nothing had ever
begun; his belief in the virtue of penitence
beggared theology itself. What he had been doing
presented itself as not merely finished, not merely
repented of, but as hardly real; at the most as
an aberration, at the least as a delusion. Certainly
he felt hardly responsible for it. An excellent
comfortable doctrine&mdash;for Harry. It rather left
out of account the other party to the transaction.</p>

<p>What a right he had to be proud of his return
to loyalty! Because Isobel Vintry was really a
most attractive girl; it would be unjust and ungrateful
to deny that, since she had&mdash;well, it was
better not to go back to that! With which reflection
he went back to it, recovering some of
the emotions of that culminating evening in the
drive; recovering them not to any dangerous
extent&mdash;Isobel was not there, the thrill of her
voice not in his ears, nor the light of her eyes
visible through the darkness&mdash;but enough to make
him pat his virtue on the back again, and again
<a class="pagenum" id="page_374" title="pg 374"></a>
excuse the aberration. Oh, they had all made
too much of it! A mere flirtation! Oh, very
wrong! Yes, yes; or where lay the marvel of
this repentance? But not so bad as all that!
They had been prejudiced to think it so serious&mdash;prejudiced
by Vivien's charms, her trust, her
simplicity, her appeal. Yes, he certainly had been
a villain even to flirt when engaged to a girl like
that. However he thoroughly appreciated that
aspect of the case now; it had needed this little&mdash;adventure&mdash;to
make him appreciate it. Perhaps
it had all been for the best. Well, that was going
too far, because Isobel felt it deeply, as her words
in the drive had shown. Yet perhaps&mdash;Harry
achieved his climax in the thought that even
for her it might have been for the best if it
stopped her from marrying Wellgood. By how
different a path, in how different a mood, had poor
Isobel attained to laying the same unction to her
smarting soul!</p>

<p>Wellgood did not know at all how quickly
matters had moved. He was still asking about
the sin&mdash;the aberration; he was not up to date
with Isobel's renunciation or Harry's comfortable
penitence. Nor was he of the school that accepts
such things without sound proof. "Lead us not
into temptation" was all very well in church;
in secular life, if you suspected a servant of dishonesty,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_375" title="pg 375"></a>
you marked a florin and left it on the
mantelpiece. Had Isobel been already his wife,
he would have locked her up in the nearest approach
to a tower of brass that modern conditions
permit; if Vivien had been already Harry's wife,
he would no doubt have been in favour of
Harry's being kept out of the way of dangerous
seductions. But now, whether as father or as
lover&mdash;and the father continued to afford the lover
most valuable aid, most specious cover&mdash;he had
first to know, to test, and to try. He had to leave
his marked florin on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that Meriton
lacked problems because Harry Belfield seemed,
for the moment at all events, to cease to present
one. For days past Billy Foot had been grappling
with a most momentous one, and Mrs. Belfield's
mind was occupied, and almost disturbed, by another
of equal gravity. Curiously enough, the two
related to the same person, and were to some
degree of a kindred nature. Both involved the
serious question of the social status&mdash;or perhaps
the social desirability would be a better term&mdash;of
Miss Doris Flower.</p>

<p>In the leisure hours and the autumn sunshine
of Meriton&mdash;an atmosphere remote from courts,
whether of law or of royalty, and inimical to
ambition&mdash;Billy was in danger of forgetting the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_376" title="pg 376"></a>
paramount claims of his career and of remembering
only the remarkable prettiness of Miss Flower.
He was once more "on the brink"; the metaphor
of a plunge found a place in his thoughts as well
as in Isobel Vintry's; some metaphors are very
maids-of-all-work. He was deplorably perturbed.
Now that the great campaign was over he abandoned
himself to the great question. He even
went up to London to talk it over with Gilly,
entertaining his brother to lunch&mdash;by no means
a casual or haphazard hospitality, for Gilly's meals
were serious business&mdash;in order to obtain his most
inspired counsel. But Gilly had been abominably,
nay, cruelly disappointing.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't waste any more time thinking
about that, old chap," said Gilly, delicately dissecting
a young partridge.</p>

<p>"You're not going out of your way to be
flattering. It appears to me at least to be a matter
of some importance whom I marry. I thought
perhaps my brother might take that view too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do, old chap. I know it's devilish
important to you. All I mean is that in this
particular case you needn't go about weighing the
question. Ask the Nun right off."</p>

<p>"You really advise it?" Billy demanded, wrinkling
his brow in judicial gravity, but inwardly
rather delighted.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_377" title="pg 377"></a>
"I do," Gilly rejoined. "Ask her right off&mdash;get
it off your mind! It doesn't matter a hang,
because she's sure to refuse you." He smiled at
his brother across the table&mdash;a table spread by that
brother's bounty&mdash;in a fat and comfortable fashion.</p>

<p>Billy preserved his temper with some difficulty.
"Purely for the sake of argument, assume that
I am a person whom she might possibly accept."</p>

<p>"Can't. There are limits to hypothesis, beyond
which discussion is unprofitable. I merely ask
you to note how much time and worry you'll be
saved if you adopt my suggestion."</p>

<p>"You'll look a particular fool if I do&mdash;and she
says yes."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure they brought the claret
you ordered, Billy?&mdash;What's that you said?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's the claret, and I'm sure you're
an idiot!" Billy crossly retorted.</p>

<p>His journey to London, to say nothing of a
decidedly expensive lunch, brought poor Billy no
comfort and no enlightenment, since he refused
his brother's plan without hesitation. His problem
became no less harassing when brought into contact
with Mrs. Belfield's problem at Halton. She
also discussed it at lunch, Harry being an absentee,
and Andy Hayes the only other guest. She had
forgotten by now that a similar question had once
arisen about Andy himself; his present position
<a class="pagenum" id="page_378" title="pg 378"></a>
would have made the memory seem ridiculous;
it had become indisputably equal to dinner at
Halton, even in Mrs. Belfield's most conservative
eyes.</p>

<p>"I have written the note you wished me to, my
dear," she remarked to her husband. "To Miss
Flower, you know, for Wednesday night. And I
apologized for my informality in not having called,
and said that I hoped Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;well, the
friend, you know, would come too."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear, thank you." Belfield
sounded really grateful; the struggle had, in fact,
been rather more severe than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>"It's not that I'm a snob," the lady went on,
now addressing herself to Billy Foot, "or prejudiced,
or in any way illiberal. Nobody could
say that of me. But it's just that I doubt how far
it's wise to attempt to mix different sections of
society. I mean whether there's not a certain
danger in it. You see what I mean, Mr. Foot?"</p>

<p>Belfield winked covertly at Andy; both had
some suspicion of Billy's feelings, and were
maliciously enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Mrs. Belfield, I&mdash;er&mdash;see what you
mean, of course. In ordinary cases there might
be&mdash;yes&mdash;a sort of&mdash;well, a sort of danger to&mdash;to&mdash;well,
to something we all value, Mrs. Belfield.
But in this case I don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_379" title="pg 379"></a>
"So Mr. Belfield says. But then he's always so
adventurous."</p>

<p>Belfield could not repress a snigger; Andy
made an unusually prolonged use of his napkin;
Billy was rather red in the face. Mrs. Belfield
gazed at Billy, not at all understanding his feelings,
but thinking that he was looking very warm.</p>

<p>"Well, Harry's engaged!" she added with a
sigh of thanksgiving. Billy grew redder still; the
other two welcomed an opportunity for open
laughter.</p>

<p>"They may laugh, Mr. Foot, but I'm sure
your mother would feel as I do."</p>

<p>A bereavement several years old saved Billy
from the suggested complication, but he glared
fiercely across the table at Andy, who assumed,
with difficulty, an apologetic gravity.</p>

<p>"All my wife's fears will vanish as soon as she
knows the lady," said Belfield, also anxious to
make his peace with Billy.</p>

<p>"I always yield to Mr. Belfield, but you can't
deny that it's an experiment, Mr. Foot." She
rose from the table, having defined the position
with her usual serene and gentle self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>Billy rose too, announcing that he would finish
his cigar in the garden. His face was still red, and
he was not well pleased with his host and Andy.
Why will people make our own most reasonable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_380" title="pg 380"></a>
thoughts ridiculous by their silly way of putting
them? And why will other stupid people laugh
at them when so presented? These reflections
accompanied poor Billy as he walked and
smoked.</p>

<p>Belfield smiled. "More sentimental complications!
I hope Billy Foot keeps his face better than
that when he's in court. Do you think he'll rush
on his fate? And what will it be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, sir," Andy answered. "I
really haven't thought about it. I don't think she
cares for him in that sort of way, though they're
awfully good friends."</p>

<p>"You seem to manage to keep heart-whole,
Andy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no time to do anything else," he
laughed.</p>

<p>"Take care; Cupid resents defiance. I've a
notion you stand very well with the lady in
question yourself."</p>

<p>"I? Oh, the idea's never entered my head."</p>

<p>"I don't say it's entered hers. The pretty
rogue told me she never fell in love, and made me
wish I was thirty years younger, and free to test
her. But she's very fond of you, Andy."</p>

<p>"I think what she told you about herself is true.
She said something like it to me too. But I'm
glad you think she likes me. I like her immensely.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_381" title="pg 381"></a>
Outside this house, she's my best friend, I think,
not counting old Jack Rock, of course."</p>

<p>"I believe Vivien would dispute the title with
her. She thinks the world of you."</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Belfield, you'll turn my head.
Seriously, I should be awfully happy to think that
true. There's nobody&mdash;well, nobody in the world
I'd rather be liked by."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I know that," said Belfield.
"And I'm glad to think she's got such a friend,
if she ever needs one."</p>

<p>A silence followed. Belfield was thinking of
Vivien, thinking that she would have been in
safer hands with Andy than with his son Harry;
glad, as he had said, to know that she would have
such a friend left to her after his own precarious
lease of life was done. Andy was thinking too,
but not of Vivien, not of sentimental complications&mdash;not
even of Harry's. Yet the thought
which he was pursuing in his mind was not
altogether out of relation to Harry, though the
relation was one that he did not consciously trace.</p>

<p>"Back to work next week, sir!" he said.
"Gilly's clamouring for me. I've had a splendid
holiday."</p>

<p>"You've put in some very good work in your
holiday. Your speeches are thought good."</p>

<p>"I somehow feel that I'm on my own legs
<a class="pagenum" id="page_382" title="pg 382"></a>
now," said Andy slowly. "I hope I've not grown
bumptious, but I'm not afraid now to think for
myself and to say what I think. I often find
people agree with me more or less."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you persuade them," Belfield suggested;
he was listening with interest, for he had
watched from outside the growth of Andy's mind,
and liked to hear Andy's own account of it.</p>

<p>"Well, I never set out to do that. I just give
them the facts, and what the facts seem to me to
point to. If they've got facts pointing the other
way, I like to listen. Of course lots of questions
are very difficult, but by going at it like that, and
taking time, and not being afraid to chuck up your
first opinion, you can get forward&mdash;or so it seems
to me at least."</p>

<p>"Chucking up first opinions is hard work, both
about things and about people."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's the way a man's mind grows, isn't
it?" He spoke slowly and thoughtfully. "Unless
you can do that, you're not really your own mental
master, any more than you're your own physical
master if you can't break off a bad habit."</p>

<p>"You've got to be a bit ruthless with yourself
in both cases, and with the opinions, and&mdash;with
the people."</p>

<p>"You've got to see," said Andy. "You must
see&mdash;that's it. You mustn't shut your eyes, or
<a class="pagenum" id="page_383" title="pg 383"></a>
turn your head away, or let anybody else look for
you."</p>

<p>"You've come into your kingdom," said Belfield
with a nod.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may claim to have got my eyes open,
to be grown up."</p>

<p>He was grown up; he stood on his own legs;
he sat no more at Harry's feet and leant no more
on Harry's arm. Harry came into his life there,
as he had in so many ways. Harry's weakness
had thrown him back on his own strength, and
forced him to rely on it. Relying on it in life, he
had found it trustworthy, and now did not fear to
rely on it in thought also. His chosen master
and leader had forfeited his allegiance, though
never his love. He would choose no other; he
would think for himself. Looking at his capacious
head, at his calm broad brow, and hearing him
slowly hammer out his mental creed, Belfield
fancied that his thinking might carry him far.
The kingdom he had come into might prove a
spacious realm.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX.<a class="pagenum" id="page_384" title="pg 384"></a></h2>

<h2>MARKED MONEY.</h2>

<p>So far as she could and dared, Isobel Vintry
withdrew herself from the company of Harry
Belfield. She relaxed her supervision of the
lovers when they were together; she tried to avoid
any risk of being alone with Harry. She knew
that Wellgood was watching her, and was determined
to give no new handle to his suspicion.
Her own feelings agreed in dictating her line of
action. In ordinary intercourse she was sure of
herself; she was not anxious to seek extraordinary
temptation. She had more resolution than Harry,
but not the same power of self-delusion, not the
same faculty of imagining that an enemy was finally
conquered because he had been once defeated or
defied. She was careful not to expose herself to
danger, either from herself or from Wellgood.
Harry had decided that all chance of danger was
over; he laughed at it now, almost literally
laughed. Yet while he derided the notion of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_385" title="pg 385"></a>
peril, he liked the flavour of memory. He kept
turning the thing over in a mood nicely compounded
of remorse and self-esteem; of penitence
for the folly, and self-congratulation over the end
that had been put to it; of wonder at his aberration,
and excuse of it in view of Isobel's attractions.
Gone as it all was in fact, it was not banished from
retrospect.</p>

<p>Wellgood grew easier in his mind. He had
marked some florins&mdash;opportunities for private
meetings rather clumsily offered; they had not been
taken. His suspicions of the past remained, but
he thought that he had effectually frightened
Isobel. He had good hopes for his own scheme
again. If she did not come round before the
wedding&mdash;now only a fortnight off&mdash;he believed
that she would afterwards. Harry finally out of
reach, his turn would come. He continued his
smoothness, and did not relax his vigilance; but,
as the days passed by, his hopes rose to confidence
again.</p>

<p>The dinner-party at Halton in the Nun's
honour went off with great success; she comported
herself with such decorum and ease that
Mrs. Belfield felt her problem solved, while Billy
Foot found his even more pressing. Vivien was
the only representative of Nutley. Wellgood had
gone to the county town to attend a meeting of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_386" title="pg 386"></a>
the County Council; the trains ran awkwardly,
and, unless the business proved very brief, he
would have to dine at the hotel, and would not
reach home till late at night. Isobel had excused
herself, pursuant to her policy of seeing as little as
possible of Harry. But the party was reinforced
by Gilly Foot, who had come down for a couple
of days' rest, and was staying at the Lion&mdash;the
great publishing house being left to take care of
itself for this short space.</p>

<p>The party was pleasant&mdash;Belfield flirting with
the Nun, Gilly discoursing in company with Mrs.
Belfield, who thought him a most intelligent young
man (as he was), Harry and Billy both in high
spirits and full of sallies, for which Vivien and
Andy, both ever choosing the modest <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, made
an applauding audience. Yet for most of the
company dinner was but a prelude to the real
business of the evening. The Nun had no opinion
of evenings which ended at ten-thirty. For this
reason, and in order to welcome Gilly and, if
possible, please his palate, she had organized a
supper at the Lion, and exhorted Mr. Dove, and
Chinks, and the cook&mdash;in a word, everybody concerned&mdash;to
a great effort. One thing only marred
the anticipations of this feast; Vivien had failed to
win leave to attend it.</p>

<p>"What do you want with supper after a good
<a class="pagenum" id="page_387" title="pg 387"></a>
dinner?" asked Wellgood brusquely. "Come
home and go to bed, like a sensible girl."</p>

<p>So Harry was to take Vivien home, and come
back to supper with all reasonable speed. The
Nun pressed Mr. Belfield to join her party after
his own was over, but gained nothing thereby, save
a disquisition on the pleasures appropriate to youth
and age respectively. "Among the latter I rank
going early to bed very high."</p>

<p>"Going to bed early is a low calculating sort of
thing to do," said Harry. "It always means that
you intend to try to take advantage of somebody
else the next morning."</p>

<p>"In the hope that he'll have been up late," said
Billy.</p>

<p>"And eaten too much," added Gilly sadly.</p>

<p>"Or even drunk too much?" suggested Belfield.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, being sent to bed is horrid,"
lamented unhappy Vivien.</p>

<p>"You've a life of suppers before you, if you
choose," Billy assured her consolingly.</p>

<p>"When I was a girl, we always had supper,"
said Mrs. Belfield.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Mrs. Belfield," said Gilly, in high
approval.</p>

<p>"Instead of late dinner, I mean, Mr. Foot."</p>

<p>Gilly could do no more than look at her, finding
no adequate comment.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_388" title="pg 388"></a>
"Supper should be a mere flirtation with one's
food," said Billy.</p>

<p>"A post-matrimonial flirtation?" asked Belfield.
"Because dinner must be wedlock! We come
back to its demoralizing character."</p>

<p>"Having established that it's wrong, we've given
it the final charm, and we'll go and do it," laughed
Billy. Mrs. Belfield had already looked once at
the clock.</p>

<p>Amid much merriment Vivien and Harry were
put into the Nutley brougham, and the rest started
to walk to the Lion, no more than half a mile from
the gates of Halton. Belfield turned back into the
house, smiling and shaking his head. The old,
old moralizing was upon him again, in its hoary
antiquity, its eternal power of striking the mind
afresh. How good it all is&mdash;and how short!
Elderly he said good-night to his elderly wife,
and in elderly fashion packed himself off to bed.
He was "sent" there under a sanction stronger,
more ruthless, less to be evaded, than that which
poor Vivien reluctantly obeyed. He chid himself;
nobody but a poet has a right to abandon his mind
to universal inevitable regrets, since only a poet's
hand can fashion a fresh garland for the tomb of
youth.</p>

<p>Half Harry's charm lay in&mdash;perhaps half his dangers
sprang from&mdash;an instinctive adaptability; he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_389" title="pg 389"></a>
was seldom out of tune with his company. With the
bold he was bold; towards the timid he displayed
a chivalrous reserve. This latter had always been
his bearing towards Vivien, even in the early days
of impulsive single-hearted devotion. It did not
desert him even to-night, although there was a
stirring in his blood, roused perhaps by the mimic
reproduction of old-time gaieties with which the
Nun proposed to enliven Meriton&mdash;a spirit of riot
and revolt, of risk and adventure in the realm of
feeling. He had little prospect of satisfying that
impulse, but he might find some solace in merry
revelry with his friends. Somehow, when more
closely considered, the revelry did not satisfy.
Good-fellowship was not what his mood was asking;
for him at least the entertainment at the
Lion offered no more, whatever tinge of romance
might adorn it for Billy Foot.</p>

<p>But he talked gaily to Vivien as they drove to
Nutley&mdash;of the trip they were to make, of the house
they were to hire for the winter and the ensuing
season (he would in all likelihood be in Parliament
by then), of their future life together. There was
no woman save Vivien in his mind, neither Isobel
nor another. He had no doubts of his recovered
loyalty; but he was in some danger of recognizing
it ruefully, as obligation and necessity, rather than
as satisfaction or even as achievement.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_390" title="pg 390"></a>
Vivien had grown knowing about him. She
knew when she, or something, or things in general,
did not satisfy his mood. "I'm glad you're going
to have a merry evening to-night," she said. "And
I'm almost glad I'm sent to bed! It'll do you
good to forget all about me for a few hours."</p>

<p>"You think I shall?" he protested gallantly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" she answered, laughing. "But I
shall expect you to be all the more glad to see me
again to-morrow."</p>

<p>He laughed rather absently. "I expect those
fellows will rather wake up the old Lion."</p>

<p>They had passed through Nutley gates and were
in the drive. Harry was next to the water, and
turned his head to look at it. Suddenly he gave
the slightest start, then looked quickly round at his
companion. She was leaning back, she had not
looked out of the window. Harry frowned and
smiled.</p>

<p>When they stopped at the door, the coachman
said, "Beg pardon, sir, but I've only just time to
take you back, and then go on to the station to
meet Mr. Wellgood. He didn't come by the
eight-o'clock, so I must meet the eleven-thirty."</p>

<p>For one moment Harry considered. "All right.
I'll walk."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. I'll start directly and take the
mare down quietly." The station lay on the other
<a class="pagenum" id="page_391" title="pg 391"></a>
side of Meriton, two miles and a half from Nutley.
The man drove off.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, you might as well have driven,
because I daren't ask you in! Father's not back,
and Isobel is sure to have gone to bed." The rules
were still strict at Nutley.</p>

<p>For a moment again Harry seemed to consider.
"I thought a walk would do me good. I may
even be able to eat some supper!" he said with a
laugh. "I shall get you into trouble if I come in,
shall I? Then I won't. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Father won't be here for an hour, nearly&mdash;but
he might ask."</p>

<p>"And you're incorrigibly truthful!"</p>

<p>"Am I? Anyhow I rather think you want to
go back to supper."</p>

<p>She would have yielded him admission&mdash;risking
her father's questions and perhaps her own
answer to them&mdash;if he had pressed. Harry did
not press; in his refraining she saw renewed
evidence of his chivalry. She gave him her cheek
to kiss; he kissed it lightly, saying, "Till to-morrow&mdash;what
there's left of me after a night of
dissipation!"</p>

<p>She opened the door with her key, waved a last
good-night to him, and disappeared into the dimly
lighted hall.</p>

<p>She was gone; the carriage was gone; Wellgood
<a class="pagenum" id="page_392" title="pg 392"></a>
would not come for nearly an hour. Harry had
not told what he had seen in the drive, nor disputed
Vivien's assurance that Isobel Vintry would
have gone to bed. Chance had put a marked
florin on the mantelpiece for Wellgood; what
were the chances of its being stolen, and of the
theft being traced?</p>

<p>To have moods is to be exposed to chances.
Many moods come and go harmlessly&mdash;free, at
least, from external consequences. Sometimes
opportunity comes pat on the mood, and the
mood is swift to lay all the blame on opportunity.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not my fault this time," thought
Harry. "And if I meet her, I can hardly walk
by without saying good-night."</p>

<p>The little adventure, with its sentimental background,
had just the flavour that his spirit had
been asking, just what the evening lacked. A
brief scene of reserved feeling, more hinted than
said, a becoming word of sorrow, and so farewell!
No harm in that, and, under the circumstances, less
from Harry would be hardly decent.</p>

<p>Isobel did not seem minded even for so much.
She came up to him with a quick resolute step.
She wore a low-cut black gown, and a black lace
scarf twisted round her neck. She bent her head
slightly, saying, "Good-night, Mr. Harry."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_393" title="pg 393"></a>
He stepped up to her, holding out his hand, but
she made no motion to take it.</p>

<p>"I've no key&mdash;I'll go in by the back door. It's
sure to be open, because Fellowes is up, waiting
for Mr. Wellgood."</p>

<p>"He won't be here for ever so long. Won't
you give me just three minutes?"</p>

<p>The lamp over the hall door showed him her
face; it was pale and tense, her lips were parted.</p>

<p>"I think I'd sooner go in at once."</p>

<p>"I want you to know that I didn't send that
answer lightly. It&mdash;it wasn't easy to obey you."</p>

<p>"Please don't let us say a single word more
about it. If you have any feeling, any consideration
for me, you'll let me go at once."</p>

<p>The moment was a bad one for her too. She
had spent an evening alone with bitter thoughts;
she had strolled out in a miserable restlessness.
Seeing the carriage pass, feeling sure that Harry
was in it, she had first thought that she would
hide herself till he had gone, then decided to try
to reach the house before he had parted from
Vivien. Her wavering landed her there at the
one wrong minute.</p>

<p>Harry glanced up at the house; every window
was dark. Vivien's room looked over the lake,
the servants' quarters to the back. There was
danger, of course; somebody might come; but
<a class="pagenum" id="page_394" title="pg 394"></a>
nobody was there to see now. The danger was
enough to incite, not enough to deter. And what
he had to say was very short.</p>

<p>"I only want to tell you how deeply sorry I
am, and to ask you to forgive me."</p>

<p>"That's soon said&mdash;and soon answered. I forgive
you, if I have anything to forgive."</p>

<p>Her voice was very low, it broke and trembled
on the last words of the sentence.</p>

<p>"I had lost the right to love you, and I hadn't
the courage to regain my freedom, with all that
meant to&mdash;to poor Vivien and&mdash;others. But at
least I was sincere. I didn't pretend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, please!" Her tones sank to a whisper;
he strained forward to catch it. "Have some mercy
on me, Harry!"</p>

<p>The old exultation and the old recklessness
seized on him. He suffered a very intoxication of
the senses. Her strength made weakness, her
stateliness turned to trembling for his sake&mdash;the
spectacle swept away his good resolves as the wind
blows the loose petals from a fading rose. Springing
forward, he tried to grasp her hands. She put
them behind her back, and stood thus, her face
upturned to his, her eyes set on him intently. He
spoke in a low hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"I can't stand any more of it. I've tried and
tried. I love Vivien in a way, and I hate to hurt
<a class="pagenum" id="page_395" title="pg 395"></a>
her. And I hate all the fuss too. But I can't do
it any more. You're the girl for me, Isobel! It
comes home to me&mdash;right home&mdash;every time I see
you. Let's face it&mdash;it'll soon be over! A minute
with you is worth an hour with her. I tell you I
love you, Isobel." He stooped suddenly and
kissed the upturned lips.</p>

<p>"You think that to-night. You won't to-morrow.
The&mdash;the other side of it will come
back."</p>

<p>"Face the other side with me, and I can stand
it. You love me&mdash;you know you do!"</p>

<p>The trees swayed, murmured, and creaked under
the wind; the water lapped on the edge of the
lake. The footsteps of a man walking up the
drive passed unheard by the engrossed lovers.
The man came to where he could see their figures.
A sudden stop; then he glided into the cover of
the bushes which fringed the lake, and began to
crawl cautiously and noiselessly towards the house.
To save Wellgood from kicking his heels for an
idle hour after dinner in the hotel, and again for
an idle half-hour at the station where he had to
change, Lord Meriton had performed, at the cost
of a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> of seven or eight miles, the friendly
office of bringing his colleague home in his motor-car.
It is to little accidents like this that impetuous
lovers are exposed. So natural when they
<a class="pagenum" id="page_396" title="pg 396"></a>
have happened&mdash;this thing had even happened
once before&mdash;so unlikely to be thought of beforehand,
they are indeed florins marked by the
cunning hand of chance.</p>

<p>Isobel made no effort to deny Harry's challenge.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you, and you know it. If I didn't,
I should be the most treacherous creature on earth,
and the worst! Even as it is, I've nothing to
boast about. But I love you, and if there were
no to-morrow I'd do anything you wish or ask."</p>

<p>"There is no to-morrow now; it will always be
like to-night." He bent again and softly kissed
her.</p>

<p>"I daren't think so, Harry! I daren't believe
it." Unconsciously she raised her voice in a little
wail. The words reached Wellgood, where he was
now crouching behind a bush. He dared come
no nearer, lest they should hear his movements.</p>

<p>Harry had lost all hold on himself now. The
pale image of Vivien was obliterated from his mind.
He had no doubt about to-morrow&mdash;how had he
ever doubted?&mdash;and he pleaded his cause with a
passion eloquent and infectious. It was hard to
meet passion like that with denial and doubt;
sorely hard when belief would bring such joy and
triumph!</p>

<p>"If you do think so to-morrow&mdash;" She slowly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_397" title="pg 397"></a>
put her hands out to him, a happy tremulous smile
on her face.</p>

<p>But before he could take her to his arms, a rapid
change came into her eyes. She held up a hand
in warning. The handle of the door had turned.
Both faced round, the door opened, and Vivien
looked out.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Isobel!" she exclaimed in
a tone of relief. "I couldn't think what had
become of you. I went into your room to tell
you about the dinner."</p>

<p>"I saw the carriage pass as I was strolling in
the drive, but when I got to the door you'd gone
in." Her voice shook a little, but her face was
now composed.</p>

<p>"It's my fault. I kept Miss Vintry talking on
the doorstep."</p>

<p>"I must go in now," said Isobel. "Good-night,
Mr. Harry."</p>

<p>Vivien looked at them in some curiosity, but
without any suspicion. A thought struck her.
"I believe I caught you talking about me," she
said with a laugh. "And not much good about
me either&mdash;because you both look a little flustered."</p>

<p>Wellgood stepped out from behind his bush.</p>

<p>"I think I can tell you what they've been talking
about, Vivien, and I will. I've had the pleasure
of listening to the last part of it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_398" title="pg 398"></a>
He stood there stern and threatening, struggling
to keep within bounds the rage that nearly mastered
him&mdash;the rage of the deceived lover trying still to
masquerade as a father's indignation. The father
should have sent his daughter away; the lover was
minded at all costs to heap shame and humiliation
on his favoured rival and on the woman who had
deceived him.</p>

<p>"Not before Vivien!" Harry cried impulsively.</p>

<p>Vivien turned eyes of wonder on him for a
moment, then the old look of remoteness settled
on her face. She stood holding on to the door,
for support perhaps, looking now at none of them,
looking out into the night.</p>

<p>"This man, your lover, was making love to
this woman, whom I employed to look after you."
He laughed scornfully. "Oh yes, a rare fool I
look! But don't they look fools too? They're
nicely caught at last. I daresay they've had a
good run, a lot of 'I love you's,' a lot of kisses
like the one I saw to-night. But they're caught
at last."</p>

<p>Vivien spoke in a low voice. "Is it true,
Isobel?" For Harry she had neither words
nor eyes.</p>

<p>"It's true," said Isobel; now her voice was
calm. "There's no use saying anything about it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_399" title="pg 399"></a>
"And you let him do it!" cried Wellgood, his
voice rising in passion. "You her friend, you her
guardian, you who&mdash;" His words seemed nearly
to choke him. He turned his fury on to Harry.
"You scoundrel, you shall pay for this! I'll
make Meriton too hot to hold you! You try
to swagger about this place as you've been doing,
you try to open your mouth in public, and I'll
be there with this pretty story! I'll make an
end of your chances in Meriton! You shall find
out what it is to make a fool of Mark Wellgood!
Yes, you shall pay for it!"</p>

<p>From the beginning Harry had found nothing
to say; what was there? His face was sunk
in a dull despair, his eyes set on the ground.
He shrugged his shoulders now, murmuring
hoarsely, "You must do as you like."</p>

<p>Suddenly Isobel spoke out. "This is your
doing. If you had let me go, as I wanted to,
this wouldn't have happened. You suspected it,
and yet you kept me here. I begged you to let
me go. You wouldn't. I tried to do the honest
thing&mdash;to end it all and go. You wouldn't let
me&mdash;you know why."</p>

<p>"You wanted to go, Isobel?" asked Vivien
gently. "And father wouldn't let you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If he likes to tell you the reason, he
can. But I say this is his doing&mdash;his! He's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_400" title="pg 400"></a>
been waiting and watching for it. Well, he's got
it now, and he must deal with it."</p>

<p>Her taunts broke down the last of Wellgood's
self-control. "Yes, I'll deal with it!" The lover
forgot the father, the father forgot his daughter.
"And I'll deal with him&mdash;the blackguard who's
interfered between me and you!"</p>

<p>Vivien turned her head towards her father with
a quick motion. His eyes were set on Isobel in
a furious jealousy. Vivien gave a sharp indrawing
of her breath. Now she understood.</p>

<p>"He shall pay for it!" cried Wellgood, and
made a dart towards Harry, raising the stick
which he had in his hand.</p>

<p>In an instant Vivien was across his path, and
caught his uplifted arm in both of hers. "Not
that way, father!"</p>

<p>"Go into the house, Vivien."</p>

<p>"For my sake, father!"</p>

<p>"Go into the house, I say. Let me alone."</p>

<p>"Not till you promise me you won't do that."</p>

<p>He looked down into her pleading face. His
own softened a little. "Very well, my girl, I
promise you I won't do that."</p>

<p>Neither Isobel nor Harry had moved; they
made no sign now. Vivien slowly loosed her grasp
of her father's arm and turned back towards the
door. Suddenly Harry spoke in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_401" title="pg 401"></a>
"I'm sorry, Vivien, awfully sorry."</p>

<p>Then she looked at him for a moment; a smile
of sad wistfulness came on her lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure you're awfully sorry, Harry."</p>

<p>She passed into the house, leaving the door
open behind her. Harry heard her slow steps
crossing the hall.</p>

<p>"There's no more to be said to-night," said
Isobel, and moved towards the door. Wellgood
was beforehand with her; he barred the way,
standing in the entrance.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's one more thing to be said." He
was calmer now, but not a whit less angry or less
vicious. "From to-night I've done with both of
you&mdash;I and my house. If you want her, take her.
If you can get him, take him&mdash;and keep him if you
can. Let him remember what I've said. I keep
my word. Let him remember! If he doesn't
want this story told, let him make himself scarce
in Meriton. If he doesn't, as God's above us,
he shall hear it wherever he goes. It shall never
leave him while I live." He turned back to
Isobel. "And I've done with you&mdash;I and my
house. Do what you like, go where you like.
You've set your foot for the last time within my
threshold."</p>

<p>Harry looked up with a quick jerk of his head.
"You don't mean to-night?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_402" title="pg 402"></a>
A grim smile of triumph came on Wellgood's
face. "Ah, but I do mean to-night. You're in love
with her&mdash;you can look after her. I'll leave you
the privilege of lodging her to-night. Rather late to
get quarters for a lady, but that's your lookout."</p>

<p>"You won't do that, Mr. Wellgood?" said
Isobel, the first touch of entreaty in her voice.</p>

<p>With an oath he answered, "I will, and this
very minute."</p>

<p>He stood there, with his back to the door,
a moment longer, his angry eyes travelling from
one to the other, showing his teeth in his vicious
smile. He had thought of a good revenge;
humiliation, ignominy, ridicule should be the
portion of the woman who had cheated him and
of the man who took her from him. There was
little thought of his daughter in his heart, or he
might have shown mercy to this other girl.</p>

<p>"I wish you both a pleasant night," he said with
a sneering laugh, then turned, went in, and banged
the door behind him. They heard the bolt run
into its socket.</p>

<p>Isobel came up to Harry. Stretching out her
arms, she laid her hands on his shoulders. Her
composure, so long maintained, gave way at last.
She broke into hysterical sobbing as she stammered
out, "O Harry, my dear, my dear, I'm so sorry!
Do forgive!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_403" title="pg 403"></a>
Harry Belfield took her face between his two
hands and kissed it; but under her embracing
hands she felt his shoulders give a little shrug.
It was his old protest against those emotions.
They had played him another scurvy trick!</p>

<p>The bolt was shot back again, the door opened.
Fellowes, the butler, stood there. He held a hat
and a long cloak in his hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Vivien told me to give you these, miss,
and to say that she wasn't allowed to bring them
herself, and that she has done her best."</p>

<p>Harry took the things from him, handed the
hat to Isobel, and wrapped her in the cloak.</p>

<p>Fellowes was an old family servant, who had
known Harry from a boy.</p>

<p>"I dare do nothing, sir," he said, and went in,
and shut the door again.</p>

<p>"It was good of Vivien," said Isobel, with
a choking sob.</p>

<p>Harry shrugged his shoulders again. "Well,
we must go&mdash;somewhere," he said.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX.<a class="pagenum" id="page_404" title="pg 404"></a></h2>

<h2>NO GOOD?</h2>

<p>At supper the fun waxed fast and harmlessly
furious. The party had received an unexpected
accession in the person of Jack Rock.
He had been caught surveying the "spread" in
company with Miss Dutton (she had declined the
alarming hospitality of Halton), old Mr. Dove,
and the Bird&mdash;a trio who had been working for
its perfection most of the day and all the evening.
Having caught Jack, the Nun would by no means
let him go. She made him sit down by her in
Harry's vacant place, declaring that room could
be found for Harry somewhere when he turned
up, and in this honourable position Jack was enjoying
himself&mdash;honestly, simply, knowing that
they were "up to their fun," neither spoilt nor
embarrassed. Old Mr. Dove, the Bird, and Miss
Miles (when the bar closed she condescended to
help at table, because she too had been in the
profession) humoured the joke, and served Jack
<a class="pagenum" id="page_405" title="pg 405"></a>
with a slyly exaggerated deference. Billy Foot
referred to him as "the eminent sportsman," and
affected to believe that he belonged to the Jockey
Club. Gilly, who knew not Jack, perceiving the
sportsman but missing the butcher, had a success
the origin of which he did not understand when
he proceeded to explain to Jack what points were
of really vital importance in a sweetbread.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen from London seem to study
everything!" exclaimed Jack admiringly.</p>

<p>"This one does credit to the local butcher," said
Gilly solemnly, and looked round amazed when all
glasses were lifted in honour of Jack Rock.</p>

<p>"Food is the only thing Gilly studies," remarked
Miss Dutton. The supper proving satisfactory,
she felt at liberty to indulge her one social gift
of a sardonic humour.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Sally," Billy agreed. "Food for
his own body and for the minds of children.
What he makes out of the latter he spends on
the former. That both are good you may see
at a glance."</p>

<p>"I find myself with something like an appetite,"
Gilly announced.</p>

<p>"That's how I likes to see folks at the Lion,"
said old Mr. Dove, easily interposing from behind
his chair. "A trifle more, sir?&mdash;Miss Miles, your
eye seems to have missed Mr. Gilbert Foot's glass."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_406" title="pg 406"></a>
"La, now, I was looking at Miss Flower's
frock!"</p>

<p>"Why, you helped to put it on me! You
ought to know it."</p>

<p>"It sets that sweet on you, Miss Flower."</p>

<p>All was merry and gay and easy&mdash;a pleasant
ending to a pleasant holiday. They all hoped to
come back for the wedding, to run down for that
eventful day, but work claimed them on the
morrow. London clamoured for the Nun&mdash;new
songs to be rehearsed now and sung in ten days.
Billy Foot had a heavy appeal at Quarter Sessions;
Gilbert Foot and Co. demanded the attention of
its constituent members.</p>

<p>"Harry's a long time getting back," Andy
remarked, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"He's dallying," said Billy. "I should dally
myself if I had the chance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he found Wellgood back; I know he
wanted to speak to him&mdash;something about the
settlements."</p>

<p>"And what might you be going to sing in
London next, miss?" asked Jack, gratefully
accepting a tankard of beer which Mr. Dove, in
silent understanding of his secret wishes, had placed
beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be Joan of Arc," said the Nun.
"Know much about her, Mr. Rock?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_407" title="pg 407"></a>
"Surely, miss! Heard of her at school. The
old gentleman used to talk about her too, Andy.
Burnt to death for a witch, poor girl, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"It seems a most appropriate part for our
hostess," remarked Billy Foot.</p>

<p>"Silly!" Miss Dutton shot out contemptously.</p>

<p>"It's rather daring, but the Management put
perfect reliance in my good taste," the Nun
pursued serenely. "In the first song I'm just
the peasant girl at&mdash;at&mdash;well, I forget the name
of the village, somewhere in France&mdash;it'll be on
the programme. In the second I'm in armour&mdash;silver
armour&mdash;exhorting the King of France.
They wanted me to be on a horse, but I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"The horse might be heard neighing?" Billy
suggested. "Off, you know."</p>

<p>"Then the horse would be where I was afraid
of being," said the Nun, and suddenly gurgled.</p>

<p>"Silver armour! My! Don't you want to
take me up to see her?" This came, in a perfectly
audible aside, from Miss Miles to the Bird. Old
Mr. Dove coughed, yet benevolently.</p>

<p>"Much armour?" asked Gilly, suddenly emerging
from a deep attention to his plate. His hopes
obviously running towards what may be styled a
classical entertainment, the question was received
with merriment.</p>

<p>"Completely encased, Gilly. I shall look like
<a class="pagenum" id="page_408" title="pg 408"></a>
a lobster. Still, Mr. Rock will come and see me,
if the rest of you don't."</p>

<p>"There are possibilities about Joan of Arc,"
Gilly pursued. "Not at all bad to lead off with
Joan of Arc. Andy, you might make a note of
Joan."</p>

<p>"If a frontispiece is of any use to you, Gilly&mdash;?"
the Nun suggested politely.</p>

<p>"What can have become of Harry?" Again
it was Andy Hayes who asked.</p>

<p>The Nun turned to him and, under cover of
Billy's imaginative description of the frontispiece,
said softly, "Can't you be happy unless you know
Harry Belfield's all right?"</p>

<p>"He's a very long time," said Andy. "And
they're early at Nutley, you know. Perhaps he's
decided to go straight home to bed."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment, but said
nothing. The tide of merry empty talk&mdash;gone
in the speaking, like the wine in the drinking, yet
not less pleasant&mdash;flowed on; only now Miss
Flower to some degree shared Andy's taciturnity.
She was not apprehensive or gloomy; it seemed
merely that some sense of the real, the ordinary,
course of life had come back to her; the hour
of careless gaiety was no longer, like Joan of Arc,
"completely encased" in silver armour.</p>

<p>Jack Rock turned to her, bashful, humble, yet
<a class="pagenum" id="page_409" title="pg 409"></a>
sure of her kindness. "I must be goin', miss;
I've to be up and about by seven. But&mdash;would
you sing to us, miss, same as you did at that
meetin'?"</p>

<p>It was against etiquette to ask the Nun to sing
on private occasions; if she chose, she volunteered.
But Jack was, naturally, innocent of the etiquette.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll sing for you. Any favourite
song, Jack?"</p>

<p>"What pleases you'll please me, miss," said old
Jack.</p>

<p>"I'll sing you an old Scotch one I happen to
know."</p>

<p>Silence obtained&mdash;from Billy Foot with some
difficulty, since he had got into an argument with
Sally Dutton&mdash;the Nun began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"My Jeany and I have toiled</p>
<p class="i2">  The livelong Summer's Day:</p>
<p>Till we were almost spoil'd</p>
<p class="i2">  At making of the Hay.</p>
<p>Her Kerchy was of holland clear,</p>
<p class="i2">  Tied to her bonny brow,</p>
<p>I whispered something in her ear;</p>
<p class="i2">  But what is that to you?"</p>
</div>

<p>The Bird, who had been dispatched to get Gilly
Foot a whisky-and-soda, came in, set it down, and
moved towards Andy. "Be still with you, Tom!"
said Jack Rock imperiously.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_410" title="pg 410"></a></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Her stockings were of Kersey green,</p>
<p class="i2">  And tight as ony silk;</p>
<p>O, sic a leg was never seen!</p>
<p class="i2">  Her skin was white as milk.</p>
<p>Her hair was black as ane could wish,</p>
<p class="i2">  And sweet, sweet was her mou'!</p>
<p>Ah! Jeany daintily can kiss;</p>
<p class="i2">  But what is that to you?"</p>
</div>

<p>"She has a way of giving those two wretched
last lines which is simply an outrage," Billy Foot
complained to the now silent Sally Dutton.</p>

<p>Again the Bird tried to edge towards Andy.
Jack Rock forbade.</p>

<p>"But I've a message," the Bird whispered
protestingly.</p>

<p>"Damn your message! She's singin' to us!"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"The Rose and Lily baith combine</p>
<p class="i2">  To make my Jeany fair;</p>
<p>There is no Benison like mine,</p>
<p class="i2">  I have a'maist no care,</p>
<p>But when another swain, my fair,</p>
<p class="i2">  Shall say 'You're fair to view,'</p>
<p>Let Jeany whisper in his ear,</p>
<p class="i2">  'Pray, what is that to you?'"</p>
</div>

<p>There was loud applause.</p>

<p>"I only sang it for Mr. Rock," said the Nun,
relapsing into a demureness which had not consistently
marked her rendering of the song.</p>

<p>Released from Jack's imprisoning eye, the Bird
<a class="pagenum" id="page_411" title="pg 411"></a>
darted to Andy and delivered his delayed message.
"Mr. Harry&mdash;Andy, if you'd step into the street,
sir&mdash;Andy, I mean&mdash;(the Bird was confused as to
social distinctions)&mdash;he's waiting&mdash;and looking
infernally put out!"</p>

<p>"He wants me&mdash;outside? Why doesn't he
come in? Well, I'll go." Andy rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"You've fired his imagination!" remarked
Gilly to the Nun. "He goes to seek adventures.
Yet your song was that of a moralist."</p>

<p>"A moralist somewhat too curious about a
stocking," Billy opined.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I never think anything of a girl who
lets her stockings get into wrinkles," the Nun
observed, as she resumed her seat. "Do you,
Jack?"</p>

<p>Her eyes had followed Andy as he went out.
To tell the truth, they had chanced to fall on him
once or twice as she sang her song. But Andy
had looked a little preoccupied; that fact had not
made her sing worse&mdash;and at last Andy had gently
drummed three fingers on the table.</p>

<p>"You've a wonderful way of puttin' it, miss,"
said old Jack Rock.</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm, saucily affectionate.
"Pray what is that to you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm off, miss. Thank you kindly. It's been
an evenin' for me!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_412" title="pg 412"></a>
She let him go, with the kindest of farewells.
A salvo of applause from the company honoured
his exit. She rested her chin in her hands, her
elbows on the table. Jack Rock was to be heard
saying his good-nights&mdash;merry chaff with old
Dove, with the Bird, with Miss Miles. Why
had Andy gone out&mdash;and Harry Belfield not
come in?</p>

<p>Billy Foot rose, moved round the table, and sat
by her. "Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"In an old book a friend gave me."</p>

<p>"I like it." Billy sounded quite convinced of
the song's merit.</p>

<p>"It has got a little bit of&mdash;of the feeling, hasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"The feeling which I've always understood you
never felt?"</p>

<p>She was securely evasive. "It's supposed to be
a man who sings it, Billy."</p>

<p>"That accounts for the foolishness of the
sentiments?"</p>

<p>"Makes them sound familiar, anyhow," said the
Nun, preferring experience to theory.</p>

<p>Andy came in. He went quickly to the Nun
and bent down over her chair.</p>

<p>"Harry's outside&mdash;with Miss Vintry. He
wants to know if he may bring her in," he said,
speaking very low.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_413" title="pg 413"></a>
Surprise got the better of the Nun's discretion.
Her voice was audible to them all, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Miss Vintry with him! At this time of night!"</p>

<p>"I think perhaps&mdash;as we've finished supper&mdash;we'd
better break up," said Andy, apologetically
addressing the company.</p>

<p>"Why? Has anything happened?" asked
Billy Foot.</p>

<p>"I think so." He bent down to the Nun
again. "Miss Vintry has got to sleep here
to-night." His voice was low, but they were all
very still, and the voice carried.</p>

<p>"There's no room for her&mdash;with Gilly here as
well as us," the Nun protested rather fretfully.</p>

<p>"You must make room somehow," he returned
firmly. "I'm going to bring them in now." He
looked significantly at Billy Foot. "We're rather
a large party."</p>

<p>Billy turned to his brother. "I'm off home.
Will you stroll with me as far as Halton?"</p>

<p>Gilly nodded in a bewildered fashion&mdash;he was
not up in Meriton affairs&mdash;and slowly rose.</p>

<p>"And when I come back I'll go straight to
bed," he said, looking at Andy to see whether
what he suggested met with acceptance.</p>

<p>Andy nodded approval; Gilly would be best
in bed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_414" title="pg 414"></a>
With the briefest farewell the brothers passed
out. As they went, they saw Harry Belfield, with
a woman on his arm, walking slowly up and down
on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Sally Dutton rose. "I'll go to bed too." As
she reached the door she turned round and said,
"At least I'll wait in my room. She&mdash;she can
come in with me, if she likes, Andy."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Andy gravely.</p>

<p>"What is it, Andy?" the Nun asked.</p>

<p>"A general break-up," he answered briefly, as
he followed Sally Dutton out of the room.</p>

<p>The Nun sat on amidst the relics of her feast&mdash;the
fruit, the flowers, the empty bottles. Somehow
they all looked rather ghastly. She gave a little
shiver of disgust.</p>

<p>Andy came in with Isobel Vintry clinging to his
arm, Harry following and carefully closing the
door.</p>

<p>Andy made Isobel sit down at the table and
offered her some wine from a half-emptied bottle.
She refused with a gesture and laid her head
between her hands on the table. Harry threw his
hat on a chair and stood helplessly in the middle
of the room. The Nun sat in a hostile silence.</p>

<p>"She'd better go straight to bed," said Andy.</p>

<p>"She can have my room. I'll go in with
Sally."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_415" title="pg 415"></a>
He looked at her. "She'd better have somebody
with her, I think. Will you call Sally?"</p>

<p>The Nun obeyed, and Sally came. As she
passed Harry, she smiled in her queer derisive
fashion, but her voice was kind as she took hold
of Isobel's arm and raised her, saying, "Come,
you're upset to-night. It won't look half so bad
in the morning."</p>

<p>Harry met Isobel and clasped her hands. Then
she and Sally Dutton went out together.</p>

<p>Harry sat down heavily in a chair by the table
and poured out a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"Do you two men want to be alone together?"
the Nun asked.</p>

<p>Harry shook his head. "I'm just off home."</p>

<p>"It's all arranged," said Andy. "Harry goes to
London by the early train to-morrow. I shall get
her things from Nutley directly after breakfast and
bring them here. You and Sally will look after
her till twelve o'clock. Then I'll take her to the
station. Harry will meet her at the other end, and&mdash;well,
they've made their plans."</p>

<p>Harry lit a cigarette and smoked it very quickly,
between gulps of wine. Andy had begun to smoke
too. His air was calm, though grave; he seemed
to have taken charge of the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Are you going to marry her?" the Nun
suddenly inquired, with her usual directness.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_416" title="pg 416"></a>
"You might have gathered that much from what
Andy said," Harry grumbled in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"Does Vivien know yet?"</p>

<p>He dropped his cigarette-end into his emptied
glass.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, frowning. "For God's sake,
don't put me through a catechism, Doris!" He
rose from his chair, looking round for his hat.</p>

<p>"Shall I walk back with you?" Andy asked.</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I'd rather be alone." His tone
was still very injured, as though the two were in
league with one another, and with all the world, to
persecute him. He came up to the Nun. "I
shan't see you again for a bit, I expect. Good-bye,
Doris." He held out his hand to her. The Nun
interlaced her hands on the table in front of her.</p>

<p>"I won't!" she said. "I won't shake hands
with you to-night, Harry Belfield. You've broken
the heart of the sweetest girl I ever met. You've
brought shame and misery on her&mdash;you who aren't
fit to black her shoes! You've brought shame on
your people. I suppose you've pretty well done
for yourself in Meriton. And all for what?
Because you must philander, must have your
conquests, must always be proving to yourself that
nobody can resist you!"</p>

<p>Harry looked morosely resentful at the indictment.
"Oh, you can't understand. Nobody can
<a class="pagenum" id="page_417" title="pg 417"></a>
understand who&mdash;who isn't made that way. You
talk as if I'd meant to do it!"</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather you had meant to do it.
That'd be rather less contemptible, I think."</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, Doris!" Andy interposed.</p>

<p>She turned on him. "Oh yes, it's always
'Gently, gently!' with Harry Belfield. He's to
be indulged, and excused, and forgiven, and all the
rest of it. Let him hear the truth for once, Andy.
Even if it doesn't do him any good to hear it, it
does me good to say it&mdash;lots of good!"</p>

<p>"You'd better go, Harry. You won't find her
good company to-night. I'll be at the station to
see you off to-morrow&mdash;before I see about the
things at Nutley."</p>

<p>"I'm going; and I'm much obliged to Doris
for her abuse. She's always been the same about
me&mdash;sneering and snarling!"</p>

<p>"I've never made a fool of myself about you.
That's what you can't forgive, Harry."</p>

<p>"Go, my dear fellow, go," said Andy. "What's
the use of this?"</p>

<p>Harry moved off towards the door. As he
went out, he said over his shoulder, "At any rate
you can't say I'm not doing the square thing
now!"</p>

<p>They heard the "Boots" open the door of the
inn for him; a moment later his step passed the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_418" title="pg 418"></a>
window. Andy came and sat down by the Nun;
she caught his big hand in hers.</p>

<p>"I'm trying hard not to cry. I don't want to
break my record. How did it all happen?"</p>

<p>"Wellgood came back before they expected him.
Harry met her&mdash;by chance, he says&mdash;after he'd left
Vivien, and he was carried away, he says. Somehow
or other&mdash;I don't quite understand how&mdash;Vivien
came on the scene again. Then Wellgood
was on to them, and had the whole thing out,
before his daughter. It seems that he's in
love with Miss Vintry himself&mdash;so I understood
Harry. That, of course, didn't make him any
kinder."</p>

<p>"It's cruel, cruel, cruel!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you remember a talk we had about
it once?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You thought this&mdash;this sort of thing
would really be the best."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Miss Wellgood. Of course,
for poor Harry&mdash;Wellgood's a dangerous enemy!"
He paused a moment. "And the thing's so bad.
He wasn't square with either of them, and they're
both in love with him, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"This woman here in love with him? Really?
Not only for the match?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for her then. She'd much better
<a class="pagenum" id="page_419" title="pg 419"></a>
not be! Oh, I daresay he'll marry her. How
much will that mean with Harry Belfield?"</p>

<p>Feeling in less danger of breaking her record,
she loosed her hold of Andy's hand. He rose.</p>

<p>"I must be off. I've a lot to do to-morrow.
Gilly'll have to look after the office. I've got to
see Mr. Belfield among other things; and Harry
wants me to see Vivien Wellgood&mdash;and, well, try
to say something for him."</p>

<p>"Just like him! He breaks the pitcher and
leaves you to sweep up the pieces!"</p>

<p>"Well, he can't see her himself, can he?"</p>

<p>"He'd make love to her again if he did. You
may be sure of that!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and Sally Dutton came in in
her dressing-gown, with her pretty hair all about
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"She's asleep&mdash;sound asleep. So I&mdash;may I stay
a few minutes with you, Doris? I&mdash;I've got the
blues awfully badly." She came to the Nun and
knelt down beside her. Suddenly she broke into
a torrent of sobs. Andy heard her say through
them, "Oh, it reminds me&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Doris looked at him and nodded. "I shall see
you soon in London, Andy?"</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and left the two girls
together.</p>

<p>Gilly Foot was smoking a reflective pipe outside
<a class="pagenum" id="page_420" title="pg 420"></a>
the door; he had possessed himself of the key and
sent the sleepy "Boots" to bed. Andy obtained
leave of absence for the morrow.</p>

<p>"Rather a disturbed evening, eh, Andy?" said
Gilly, smoking thoughtfully. "Lucky it didn't
happen till we'd done supper! Fact is one
doesn't like to say it of an old friend&mdash;but Harry
Belfield's no good."</p>

<p>Andy had a whimsical idea that at such a sentiment
the stones of Meriton High Street would cry
out. The pet and the pride of the town, the man
of all accomplishments, the man who was to have
that wonderful career&mdash;here he was being cavalierly
and curtly dismissed as "no good."</p>

<p>"Come, we must give him another chance,"
Andy urged.</p>

<p>Gilly knocked out his pipe with an air of
decision.</p>

<p>"Rotten&mdash;rotten at the core, old boy, that's it,"
he said, as with a nod of good-night he entered the
precincts of the Lion.</p>

<p>Andy Hayes was sore to the heart. He had
thought that a catastrophe such as this, a "row,"
would be the best thing&mdash;the best for Vivien Wellgood.
He was even surer of it now&mdash;even now,
when to think of the pain she suffered sent a pang
through his heart. But what a light that increased
certainty of his threw on Harry Belfield! And,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_421" title="pg 421"></a>
as he said to himself, trudging home from the
Lion, Harry had always been a part of his life&mdash;in
early days a very big part&mdash;and one of the most
cherished. Harry's hand had been the source
whence benefits flowed; Harry's example had
been an inspiration. Whatever Harry had done
now, or might do in the future&mdash;that future now
suddenly become so much less assured, so much
harder to foresee&mdash;the great debt remained. Andy
did not grudge "sweeping up the pieces." Alas,
that he could not mend the broken pitcher! Sore
as his heart was for the blow that had fallen on
Vivien&mdash;on her so frail that the lightest touch of
adversity seemed cruel&mdash;yet his sorest pain was
that the blow came from Harry Belfield's hand.
That filled him with a shame almost personal. He
had so identified himself with his friend and hero,
he had so shared in and profited by the good in
him&mdash;his kindness, his generosity, his championship&mdash;that
he could not rid himself of a feeling of
sharing also in the evil. In the sullying of Harry's
honour he saw his own stained&mdash;even as by
Harry's high achievements he would have felt his
own friendship glorified.</p>

<p>"Without Harry I should never have been
where or what I am." That was the thought in
his mind, and it was a sure verity. Harry had
opened the doors, he had walked through. Whatever
<a class="pagenum" id="page_422" title="pg 422"></a>
Harry had done or would do with his own
life, he had done much for his friend's, and done it
gaily and gladly. Doris Flower might chide and
despair; Gilly Foot's contemptuous verdict might
dismiss Harry to his fate. That could not be Andy's
mood nor Andy's attitude. Gratitude forbade
despair; it must be his part still to work, to aid,
to shelter; always, above all, to forgive, and to try&mdash;at
least to try&mdash;to comprehend.</p>

<p>Love or friendship can set no higher or harder
task than in demanding the comprehension of a
temperament utterly diverse, alien, and incompatible.
That was the task Andy's heart laid on
his brain. "You must not give up," was its
command. Others might take their pleasure in
Harry's gifts, might enjoy his brilliance, or reap
benefit from his ready kindness&mdash;and then, when
trouble came, pass by on the other side. There
was every excuse for them; in the common traffic
of life no more is asked or expected; men, even
brilliant men, must behave themselves at their
peril. Andy did not stand so. It was his to try
to assess Harry's weakness, and to see if anywhere
there could be found a remedy, a buttress for the
weak wall in that charming edifice. Such a pity if
it fell down, with all its beauties, just because of
that one weak wall! But, alas, poor Andy was
ill-fitted for this exacting task of love's. He might
<a class="pagenum" id="page_423" title="pg 423"></a>
tell himself where his duty lay; he might argue
that he could and did understand how a man might
have a weak spot, and yet be a good man&mdash;one
capable of useful and high things. But his instinct,
the native colour of his mind, was all against these
arguments. The shame that such a man should do
such things was stronger. The weak spot seemed
to spread in ever-widening circles; the evil seemed
more and more to invade and infect the system;
the weak wall doomed the whole edifice. Reason,
argue, and pray for his friend as he might, in his
inmost mind a voice declared that this day had
witnessed the beginning of the end of the Harry
Belfield whom he had loved.</p>

<p>"Harry Belfield's no good!" "How are the
mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished!"</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI.<a class="pagenum" id="page_424" title="pg 424"></a></h2>

<h2>THE EMPTY PLACE.</h2>

<p>Belfield rubbed his hands against one
another with a rueful smile. "Yes, yes,
he's a hard fellow. He's hard on us; hard in
taking a course that makes scandal inevitable.
Meriton High Street will be breast-high in gossip
about the midnight expulsion in a few hours.
And hard in this&mdash;I suppose I'm not entitled to
call it persecution&mdash;this punishment with which he
threatens Harry. Still, if a man had treated my
daughter in that way, and that daughter Vivien&mdash;"
He spread out his hands, and added, "But then
he's always been as hard as nails to the poor girl
herself. You think there's that other motive? If
you're right there, I put my foot in it once."
He was thinking of certain hints he had given
Wellgood at dinner one evening.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it, I think, sir, but it
doesn't help us much. It may show that Wellgood's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_425" title="pg 425"></a>
motives aren't purely paternal, but it doesn't
make matters better for Harry."</p>

<p>"It's terribly awkward&mdash;with us at one end of
the town and Nutley at the other. Most things
blow over, but"&mdash;he screwed up his face wryly&mdash;"meeting's
awkward! And there's the politics!
Wellgood's chairman of his Association. Oh,
Harry, Harry, you have made a mess of it! I
think I'll go and talk it over with Meriton&mdash;make
a clean breast of it and see what he says. He
might be able to keep Wellgood quiet. You don't
look as if you thought there was much chance
of it."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether Harry would come back
and face it, even if Wellgood were managed. A
tough morsel for his pride to swallow! And if he
did, could he bring her&mdash;at all events so long as
Miss Wellgood's at Nutley? Yet if they marry&mdash;and
I suppose they will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think we may take it that he'll marry her.
The boy's ungoverned and untrustworthy, but he's
not shabby, Andy." A note of pleading for his
son crept into his voice.</p>

<p>"It's the right thing for him to do, but it'll
make it still more difficult to go on as if nothing
had happened. However I hope you will see
Lord Meriton and get his opinion."</p>

<p>"I should like you to talk to Wellgood and find
<a class="pagenum" id="page_426" title="pg 426"></a>
out what his terms really are. I can't ask favours
of him, but I want to know exactly where we stand.
And Vivien&mdash;no, I must write to her myself, poor
dear girl. Not a pleasant letter to write." He
paused a moment and asked, with an air of being
rather ashamed of the question, "Is the sinner
himself very desperate?"</p>

<p>"Last night he was, I think; at any rate terribly
angry with himself, and&mdash;I'm afraid I must add&mdash;with
his bad luck. When I saw him off this
morning he was in one of his defiant moods, saying
he could get on without Meriton's approval, and
wishing the whole place at the devil."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's Harry! Because he's made
a fool&mdash;and worse&mdash;of himself, you and I and
Meriton are to go to the devil! Well, I suppose
it's not peculiar to poor Harry. And you saw him
off? I can't thank you for all your kindness,
Andy."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if a man can feel that way, I'd
almost rather have done the thing myself! I've
got to ask her to see me on his behalf."</p>

<p>Belfield shook his head. "Not much to be said
there. And I've got to tell my wife. Not much
there either."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mrs. Belfield will be terribly
distressed."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but mothers wear special spectacles,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_427" title="pg 427"></a>
you know. She'll think it very deplorable, but
it's quite likely that she'll find out it's somebody
else's fault. Wellgood's, probably, because she
never much liked him. If it helps her, let her
think so."</p>

<p>"It was partly his fault. Why didn't he own
up about Miss Vintry?"</p>

<p>"Not much excuse, even if you'd been the trespasser.
With Harry engaged to Vivien, no excuse
at all. How could it be in any legitimate way
Harry's business what Wellgood wanted of Isobel
Vintry? Still it may be that the argument'll be
good enough for his mother."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'll see Wellgood to-day, and let
you know the result. And Miss Wellgood too, if
she'll see me. I positively must go to London
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. You go back to work, Andy.
You've your own life. And that pretty girl, Miss
Flower&mdash;does she go back too?"</p>

<p>"She goes this afternoon. And Billy Foot with
them, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he does. I forgot. Give her my
love. I'd come and give her a nosegay at the
station, only I don't feel like facing people to-day."
He sighed wearily. "A man's pride is easily
hit through his children. And I suppose we've
cracked Harry up to the skies! Nemesis, Andy,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_428" title="pg 428"></a>
Nemesis! There, good-bye. You're a thorough
good fellow."</p>

<p>Billy Foot waylaid Andy as he left Halton.
Billy's view of the matter was not ideal or exalted,
but it went to a practical point.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know such a fool?" cried Billy.
"What does he want to do it down here for?
He's got all London to play the fool in, if he must
play the fool! Nobody knows there, or if they do
they don't care. Or if A cares B doesn't, and B's
just as amusing to dine with&mdash;probably more so.
But in this little hen-roost of a place! All the
fowls'll cackle, and all to the same tune. I'll lay
you six to four he's dished himself for good in
Meriton. Where are you off to?"</p>

<p>"I've got to see Miss Vintry off, then I'm
going to Nutley. By-the-bye, how did you hear
about it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't hard to guess, last night, was it?
However, to inform my mind better, Andy, I took
occasion to call at the Lion. I didn't see Miss
Vintry, but I did see Miss Flower. Also I saw
old Dove, and young Dove, and Miss Miles, all
with faces as long as your arm&mdash;and enjoying themselves
immensely! You can no more keep it dark
in a place like this than you can hide the parish
church under your pocket-handkerchief. They'll
all know there was a row at Nutley; they'll all
<a class="pagenum" id="page_429" title="pg 429"></a>
know Miss Vintry was turned out and slept at the
Lion; they'll all know that Harry and she have
gone to London, and, of course, they'll know the
engagement's broken. They're not clever, I admit&mdash;I've
made speeches to them&mdash;but I suppose
they're not born idiots! They must have a rudimentary
inductive faculty."</p>

<p>The truth of these words was clearly shown to
Andy's mind when he called at the Lion to pick up
Isobel. She was alone in the Nun's sitting-room;
the two girls had already said good-bye to her and
gone out for a last walk in Meriton. When she
came into the hall to meet him she was confronted
by a phalanx of hostile eyes&mdash;Miss Miles', old
Dove's, the Bird's, two chambermaids', the very
"Boots" who had officiated at the door on the
previous night. Nobody spoke to her. Her
luggage, sent down from Nutley in answer to
Andy's messenger, was already on the cab. Andy
was left himself to open the door. Nobody even
wanted a tip from her. Could unpopularity go
further or take any form more glaring?</p>

<p>Before the hostile eyes (she included Andy's
among them) Isobel was herself again&mdash;calm,
haughty, unabashed, her feelings under full control.
There were no signs of the tempest she had passed
through; she was again the Miss Vintry who had
given lessons in courage and the other manly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_430" title="pg 430"></a>
virtues. Andy was unfeignedly glad that this was
her condition; his practical equipment included
small aptitude for dealing with hysterics.</p>

<p>For the better part of the way to the station she
said nothing. At last she looked across at Andy,
who sat opposite to her, and remarked, "Well,
Mr. Hayes, you saw the beginning; now you see
the end."</p>

<p>"Since it has happened, I can only hope the end
will be happy&mdash;for you and for him."</p>

<p>"I'm getting what I wanted. If you want a
thing and get it, you can hardly complain, whatever
happens."</p>

<p>"That sounds very reasonable, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The best thing to hope about reason is to hope
you won't need it? Yes!"</p>

<p>It seemed that the news had not yet spread so
far afield as to reach the station. The old stationmaster
was friendly and loquacious.</p>

<p>"Quite a break-up of you all to-day, sir," he
said. "Mr. 'Arry gone by the first train, the
stout gentleman by the next, now Miss Vintry,
and a carriage engaged for Miss Flower's party
and Mr. Foot this afternoon! A real break-up, I
call it!"</p>

<p>"That's about what it comes to, Mr. Parsons,"
said Andy, as he handed Isobel into the
train.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_431" title="pg 431"></a>
"Well, 'olidays must 'ave an end. A pleasant
journey and a safe return, miss."</p>

<p>Isobel smiled at Andy. "You'd stop at the
first part of the wish, Mr. Hayes?"</p>

<p>Andy put out his hand to her. With the slightest
air of surprise she took it. "We must make the
best of it. Do what you can for him."</p>

<p>"I'll do all he'll let me." Her eyes met his;
she smiled. "I know all that as well as you do.
Surely I, if anybody, ought to know it?" It
seemed to Andy as if that were what her eyes and
her smile said. "I want you to deliver one
message for me," she went on. "Don't be
alarmed, I'm not daring to send a message to
anybody who belongs to Meriton. But when
you next see Miss Dutton, will you tell her I
shan't forget her kindness? I've already thanked
Miss Flower for the use of her sitting-room. Ah,
we're moving! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She was smiling as she went. Andy was smiling
too; the degree of her gratitude to Sally
Dutton and to the Nun respectively had been
admirably defined.</p>

<p>The fire of Wellgood's wrath was still smouldering
hotly, ready to break out at any moment if the
slightest breath of passion fanned it. He received
Andy civilly enough, but at the first hint that he
came in some sort as an ambassador from Harry's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_432" title="pg 432"></a>
father, his back stiffened.  His position was
perfectly clear, and seemed unalterable. So far as
it lay in his power he would banish Harry Belfield
from Meriton and put an end to any career he
might have there.  He repeated to Andy more
calmly, but not less forcibly, what he had shouted
in his fury the evening before.</p>

<p>"Of course I want it kept as quiet as possible;
but I don't want it kept quiet at the cost of that
fellow's going unpunished&mdash;getting off scot-free!
We've nothing to be ashamed of.  Publicity won't
hurt us, little as we may like it. But it'll hurt him,
and he shall have it in full measure&mdash;straight in
the face. Is it a possible state of things that he
should be here, living in the place, taking part in
our public affairs, being our Member, while my
daughter is at Nutley?  I say no, and I think
Belfield&mdash;his father, I mean&mdash;ought to be able to
see it for himself.  What then?  Are we to be
driven out of our home?"</p>

<p>"That would be absurd, of course," Andy had
to admit.</p>

<p>"It seems to me the only alternative." He rose
from his chair, and walked up and down like an
angry tiger. He faced round on Andy. "For a
beginning, the first step he takes in regard to the
seat, I shall resign from the committee of the
Association, and state my reasons for my action in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_433" title="pg 433"></a>
plain language&mdash;and I think you know I can speak
plainly. I shall do the same about any other public
work which involves meeting him.  I shall do the
same about the hunt, the same about everything.
And I'll ask my friends&mdash;I'll ask decent people&mdash;to
choose between Harry Belfield and me.  To
please my daughter, I didn't break his head, as I
should have liked to, but, by heaven, I'll spoil his
game in Meriton!  I'm afraid that's the only
message I can give you to take to Halton."</p>

<p>"In fact you'll do your best to get him boycotted?"
Andy liked compendious statements.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I mean to do, Hayes.  A
man going to be married to my daughter in a fortnight&mdash;parted
from her the moment before on the
footing of her lover&mdash;found making violent love
to another inmate of my house, her companion,
almost within my very house itself&mdash;sounds well,
doesn't it?  Calculated to recommend him to his
friends, and to the constituency?"</p>

<p>Andy tried a last shot. "Is this action of yours
really best for Miss Wellgood, or what she would
wish?"</p>

<p>Wellgood flushed in anger, conscious of his
secret motives, by no means sure that he was not
suspected of them. "I judge for my daughter.
And it's not what she may wish, but what is proper
in regard to her that I consider.  On the other
<a class="pagenum" id="page_434" title="pg 434"></a>
hand, if he lets Meriton alone, he may do what he
likes. That's not my affair. I'm not going to
hunt him over the whole country."</p>

<p>"Well, that's something," said Andy with a
patient smile. "I'll communicate your terms to
Mr. Belfield." He paused, glancing doubtfully
at his most unconciliatory companion. "Do you
think it would be painful to Miss Wellgood to see
me?"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly in his prowling up and
down the room. "That's funny! She was just
saying she would like to see you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that. I want to be quite
frank. Harry has asked me to express to her his
bitter regret."</p>

<p>"Nothing more than that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, on my honour."</p>

<p>"She wants to say something to you." He
frowned in hesitation. "If I thought there was
the smallest chance of her being induced to enter
into direct communication with him, I'd say no at
once. But there's no chance of that. And she
wants to see you. Yes, you can see her, if you
like. She's in the garden, by the lake, I think.
She's taken this well, Hayes; she's showing a
thousand times more pluck than I ever thought
she had." His voice grew gentle. "Poor little
girl! Yes, go! She wants to see you."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_435" title="pg 435"></a>
Andy had taken nothing by his first mission; he
felt quite hopelessly unfit for his second. To offer
the apologies of a faithless swain was no more in
his line than to be a faithless swain himself; the
fleeting relics of Harry's authority had imposed a
last uncongenial task. Perhaps his very mum-chanceness
was his saving. Glib protestations
would have smacked too strongly of the principal
to commend the agent. Vivien heard his stammering
words in silence, seeming wrapped in an aloofness
that she took for her sole remaining protection.
She bowed her head gravely at the "bitter regret,"
at the "unguarded moment," at the "fatal irresolution"&mdash;Andy's
memory held fast to the phrases,
but refused to weld them into one of Harry's
shapely periods. On "fatal irresolution" he came
to a full stop. He dared not look at her&mdash;it would
seem an intrusion, a brutality; he stared steadily
over the lake.</p>

<p>"I knew he had moods like that," she said after
a long silence. "I never realized what they could
do to a man. I daresay it would be hard for me
to realize. I'm glad he wanted to&mdash;to say a
word of regret. There's one thing I should
like you to tell him; that's why I wanted to see
you."</p>

<p>Now Andy turned to her, for her voice commanded
his attention.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_436" title="pg 436"></a>
"How fagged-out you look, Miss Wellgood!"
he exclaimed impulsively.</p>

<p>"Things aren't easy," she said in a low steady
voice. "If I could have silence! But I have to
listen to denunciation. You'll understand. Did
he tell you what&mdash;what passed?"</p>

<p>"The gist of it, I think."</p>

<p>"Then you'll understand that I mayn't have the
power to stop the denunciations, or&mdash;or the other
steps that may be threatened or taken. I should
like him to know that they're not my doing. And
I should like him to know too that I would a
thousand times sooner this had happened than that
other thing which I believe he meant to happen&mdash;honestly
meant to happen&mdash;but for&mdash;this accident."</p>

<p>"I'm with you in that, Miss Wellgood. It's far
better."</p>

<p>"I accept what he says&mdash;an unguarded moment.
But I&mdash;I thought he had a guard." She sat silent
again for a minute. "There's one other thing I
should like to say to him, through you. But
you'll know best whether to say it or not, I think.
I should like to tell him that he can't make me
forget&mdash;almost that he can't make me ungrateful.
He gave me, in our early days together, the first
real joy I'd ever had&mdash;I expect the only perfect
joy I ever shall have. What he gave then, he
can't wholly take away." She looked at Andy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_437" title="pg 437"></a>
with a faint melancholy smile. "Shall you tell
him that?"</p>

<p>"If you leave it to me, I shan't tell him that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You want it all over, don't you?" he asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!"</p>

<p>"Then don't tell Harry Belfield that. Think
it, if you like. Don't tell him."</p>

<p>A look of sheer wonder came into her eyes.
"He's like that?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, like that. That's the trouble. He'd
better think you're&mdash;hopelessly disgusted."</p>

<p>"I'm hopelessly at sea, anyhow," she said, turning
her eyes to the lake again. But she turned
back to him quickly, still with her faint smile.
"Disgusted? Oh, you're thinking of the fastidiousness?
Ah, that seems a long time ago! You
were very kind then; you're very kind now."
She laid her hand lightly on his arm; for the first
time her voice shook. "You and I can sometimes
talk about him as he used to be&mdash;just we two
together!"</p>

<p>"Or as we thought he was?" Andy's tones were
blunt still, and now rather bitter.</p>

<p>"Or as we thought he was&mdash;and, by thinking
it, were so happy! Yes, we'd better not talk about
him at all. I don't think I really could. You'll
<a class="pagenum" id="page_438" title="pg 438"></a>
be seeing Mr. Belfield soon? Give him my dear
love, and say I'll come and see him and Mrs.
Belfield as soon as they want me. He sent me a
note this morning. I can't answer it just yet."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him." Andy rose to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, but must you go just yet? I don't want
you to." She glanced up at him, with a sad
humour. "Curly's out, you know, and terribly
big and rampageous!"</p>

<p>"But you're not running away now, any more
than you did then."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to stand still, and&mdash;and look at it&mdash;at
what it means about life."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think all life's like that&mdash;or all
men either."</p>

<p>"That's the temptation&mdash;to think that."</p>

<p>"Men are tempted to think it about women
too, sometimes."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, of course, that's true.
I'm glad you said that. You are good against
Curly!"</p>

<p>They had Wellgood in their minds. It was
grievance against grievance at Nutley; the charge
of inconstancy is eternally bandied to and fro
between the sexes&mdash;<i>Varium et mutabile semper
Femina</i> against "Men were deceivers ever"&mdash;<i>Souvent
femme varie</i> against the sorrowfully ridiculous
chronicles of breach of promise of marriage
<a class="pagenum" id="page_439" title="pg 439"></a>
cases. Plenty of matter for both sides! Probably
both sides would be wise to say as little as possible
about it. If misogyny is bad, is misandry any
better? At all events the knowledge of Wellgood's
grievance might help to prevent Vivien's
from warping her mind. Hers was the greater,
but his was of the same order.</p>

<p>The world incarnated itself to her in the image
of the big retriever dog, being so alarming, meaning
no harm consciously, meaning indeed affection&mdash;with
its likelihood of paws soiling white raiment.
Andy again stood dressed as the guardian, the
policeman. He was to be "good against Curly."</p>

<p>"And Isobel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I saw her off all right by the twelve-fifteen,
Miss Wellgood&mdash;to London, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, to London." To both of them London
might have been spelt "Harry."</p>

<p>"She was never really unkind to me," said
Vivien thoughtfully. "I expect it did me good."</p>

<p>"Never a favourite of mine&mdash;even before this,"
Andy pronounced, rather ponderously.</p>

<p>She shot a side glance at him. "I believe you
thought she beat me!"</p>

<p>"I think I thought that sometimes you'd
sooner she had done that than stand there
smiling."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're prejudiced! She wasn't unkind;
<a class="pagenum" id="page_440" title="pg 440"></a>
and in this thing, you see, I know her temptation.
Surely that ought to bring sympathy? Tell me&mdash;you
saw her off&mdash;well&mdash;how?" She spoke in jerks,
now seeming agitated.</p>

<p>"Very calm&mdash;quite her own mistress&mdash;seeming
to know what her job was. Confound it, Miss
Wellgood, I'd sooner not talk about her any
more!"</p>

<p>"Shall you see Harry?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to till&mdash;till things have settled
down a bit. I shall write about what you've
said."</p>

<p>"About part of what I've said," she reminded
him. "You've convinced me about that."</p>

<p>Andy rose again, and this time she did not seek
to hinder him.</p>

<p>"I'm off to town to-morrow; back to work."
He paused a moment, then added, "If I get
down for a week-end, may I come and see
you?"</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;always, if you can. And remember me
to Miss Flower and to Billy Foot; and tell them
that I am"&mdash;she seemed to seek a word, but ended
lamely&mdash;"very well, please."</p>

<p>Andy nodded. She wanted them to know that
her courage was not broken.</p>

<p>On his way out he met Wellgood again, moodily
sauntering in the drive by the lake.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_441" title="pg 441"></a>
"Well, what do you think of her?" Wellgood
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"She's feels it terribly, but she's taking it
splendidly."</p>

<p>Wellgood nodded emphatically, saying again,
"I never thought she had such pluck."</p>

<p>"I should think, you know," said Andy, in his
candid way, "that you could help her a bit, Mr.
Wellgood. It does her no good to be taken
over it again and again. Least said, soonest
mended."</p>

<p>Wellgood looked at him suspiciously. "I'm
not going back on my terms."</p>

<p>"Wait and see if they are accepted. Let him
alone till then. She'd thank you for that."</p>

<p>"I want to help her," said Wellgood. His
tone was rather surly, rather ashamed, but it
seemed to carry a confession that he had not
helped his daughter much in the past. "You're
right, Hayes. Let's be done with the fellow for
good, if we can!"</p>

<p>From all sides came the same sentiment: from
Wellgood as a hope, from Vivien as a sorrowful
but steadfast resolution, from Billy Foot as a considered
verdict on the facts of the case. Andy's
own reflections had even anticipated these other
voices. An end of Harry Belfield, so far as
regarded the circle of which he had been the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_442" title="pg 442"></a>
centre and the ornament! Would Harry accept
the conclusion? He might tell Meriton to "go
to the devil" in a moment of irritated defiance;
but to abandon Meriton would be a great rooting-up,
a sore break with all his life past, and with
his life in the future as he had planned it and
his friends had pictured it for him. Must he
accept it whether he would or not? Wellgood's
pistol was at his head. Would he brave the shot,
or what hand would turn away the threatening
barrel?</p>

<p>Not Lord Meriton's. When Belfield, possessed
of Wellgood's terms, laid them before him, together
with an adequate statement of the facts, the great
man disclaimed the power. Though he softened
his opinion for Harry's father, it was very doubtful
if he had the wish.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Belfield, uncommon sorry&mdash;well,
you know that&mdash;both for you and for Mrs. Belfield.
I hope she's not too much cut up?"</p>

<p>"She's distressed; but she blames Wellgood
and the other woman most. I'm glad she does."</p>

<p>Meriton nodded. "But it's most infernally
awkward; there's no disguising it. You may say
that any man&mdash;at any rate, many a man&mdash;is liable
to come a mucker like this. But happening just
now&mdash;and with Wellgood's daughter! Wellgood's
our right hand man, in this part of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_443" title="pg 443"></a>
Division at all events. And he's as stubborn a
dog as lives! Said he'd resign from the hunt if
your boy showed up, did he? By Jove, he'd do
it, you know! That's the deuce of it! I suppose
the question is how much opinion he'd carry with
him. He's not popular&mdash;that's something; but
a father fighting in his daughter's cause! They
won't know the other side of it you've told me
about; and if Harry marries the woman, he can't
very well tell them. Then is she to come with
him? Awkward again if Wellgood, or somebody
put up by him, interrupts! If she doesn't come,
that's at once admitting something fishy."</p>

<p>"The woman's certainly a serious added difficulty.
Meriton, we're old friends. Tell me your
own opinion."</p>

<p>"I don't give an opinion for all time. The
affair will die down, as all affairs do. The girl'll
marry somebody else in time, I suppose. Wellgood
will get over his feelings. I'm not saying
your son can't succeed you at Halton in due
course. That would be making altogether too
much of it. But now, if the moment comes anywhere,
say, in the next twelve months&mdash;well, I
question if a change of air&mdash;and another constituency&mdash;wouldn't
be wiser."</p>

<p>"I think so too&mdash;in his own interest. And I
rather think that I, at least, owe it to Vivien to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_444" title="pg 444"></a>
throw my weight on the side that will save her
from annoyance."</p>

<p>"That was in my mind too, Belfield; but I
knew you'd think of it without my saying it."</p>

<p>"I believe&mdash;I do really believe&mdash;that he will
look at it in that light himself. Any gentleman
would; and he's that, outside his plaguy love
affairs."</p>

<p>"I know he is; I know it. They bring such
a lot of good fellows to grief&mdash;and pretty women
too."</p>

<p>"Well, I must write to him; and you must look
out for another candidate."</p>

<p>"By Jove, we must, and in quick time too!
Apart from a General Election, I hear old Millington's
sadly shaky. Well, good-bye, Belfield. My
regards to your wife." He shook hands warmly.
"This is hard luck on you; but he's got lots of
time to pick up again. He'll end in the first flight
yet. Cheer up. Better have a Prodigal than no
son at all, like me!"</p>

<p>"I imagine a good deal might be said on both
sides in that debate."</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff and nonsense! You wouldn't dare
to say that to his mother!"</p>

<p>"No; and I don't suppose I really think it
myself. But this sort of thing does make a man
a bit nervous, Meriton."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_445" title="pg 445"></a>
"If the lady's attractions have led him astray,
perhaps they'll be able now to keep him straight."</p>

<p>"They won't be so great in one particular.
They won't be forbidden fruit."</p>

<p>"Aye, the best fox is always in the covert you
mayn't draw. Human nature!"</p>

<p>"At all events, my boy Harry's."</p>

<p>And for that nature Harry had to pay. The
present price was an end of his career in Meriton.
One more voice joined the chorus, a powerful
voice. Belfield bowed his head to the decision.
It was final for the moment; in his depression of
spirit he felt as though it were final for all time, as
though his native town would know Harry no
more. At any rate, now his place was vacant&mdash;the
place from which he by transgression fell. It must
be given to another. Only in Vivien's memory
had he still his niche.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_446" title="pg 446"></a></h2>

<h2>GRUBBING AWAY.</h2>

<p>Gilly Foot's mind was so inventive, and his
demand for ministerial assistance in carrying
out his inventions so urgent, during the next three
weeks that Andy had little leisure for his own or
anybody else's private affairs. The week-ends at
Meriton had to be temporarily suspended, and Meriton
news reached him now by a word from Billy, who
seemed to be in touch with Belfield, now through
Jack Rock. Thus he heard from Billy that Harry
Belfield was married and had gone abroad; while
Jack sent him a copy of the local paper, with a
paragraph (heavily marked in blue pencil) to the
effect that Mr. Harry Belfield, being advised by his
doctor to take a prolonged rest, had resigned his
position as prospective candidate for the Meriton
Division. Decorous expressions of regret followed,
and it was added that probably Mr. Mark
Wellgood, Chairman of the Conservative Association,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_447" title="pg 447"></a>
would be approached in the matter. Jack
had emphasized his pencil-mark with a large note
of exclamation, in which Andy felt himself at
liberty to see crystallized the opinion of Harry's
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Still, though Meriton had for the time to be
relegated mainly to memory, there it had a specially
precious pigeon-hole. It had regained for him all
its old status of home. When he thought of holidays,
it was of holidays at Meriton. When his
thoughts grew ambitious&mdash;the progress of Gilbert
Foot and Co. began to justify modest ambitions&mdash;they
pictured a small house for himself in or near
Meriton, and a leisure devoted to that ancient
town's local affairs. To himself he was a citizen
of Meriton more than of London; for to Andy
London was, foremost of all, a place of work. Its
gaieties were for him occasional delights, rather
than a habitual part of the life it offered. Talks
with Jack Rock and other old friends, visits to
Halton and Nutley, completed the picture of his
future life at home. He was not a man much
given to analysing his thoughts or feelings, and
perhaps did not realize how very essential the setting
was to the attractiveness of the picture, nor that
one part of the setting gave the picture more charm
than all the rest. Yet when Andy's fancy painted
him as enjoying well-earned hours of repose at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_448" title="pg 448"></a>
Meriton, the terrace by the lake at Nutley was
usually to be seen in the foreground.</p>

<p>Let Gilly clamour never so wildly for figures to
be ready for him by the next morning, in order
that he might know whether the latest child of his
genius could be reared in this hard world or must
be considered merely as an ideal laid up in the
heavens, an evening had to be found to go and
see the Nun as Joan of Arc&mdash;first as the rustic
maid in that village in France (its name was on the
programme), and then, in silver armour, exhorting
the King of France (who was supposed to be on
horseback in the wings). The question of the
Nun's horse was solved by an elderly white animal
being discovered on the stage when the curtain
rose&mdash;the Nun was assumed to have just dismounted
(voluntarily)&mdash;and being led off to the
blare of trumpets. This was for the second song,
of course, and it was the second song which
brought Miss Doris Flower the greatest triumph
that she had ever yet achieved. Its passing references
to the favour of Heaven were unexceptionable
in taste&mdash;so all the papers declared; its
martial spirit stirred the house; its tune caught
on immensely; and, by a happy inspiration, Joan
of Arc had (as she was historically quite entitled
to have) a prophetic vision of a time when the
relations between her own country and England
<a class="pagenum" id="page_449" title="pg 449"></a>
would be infinitely happier than they were in the
days of Charles VII. and Henry VI. This vision
having fortunately been verified, the public applauded
Joan of Arc's sentiments to the echo,
while the author and the management were very
proud of their skill in imparting this touch of
"actuality" to the proceedings. Finally, the Nun
was in excellent voice, and the silver armour suited
her figure prodigiously well.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a great go," said Miss Flower contentedly,
when Andy went round to her room to
see her. She draped a Japanese dressing-gown
over the silver armour, laid her helmet on the
table, and lit a cigarette. "It knocks the Quaker
into a cocked hat, and makes even the Nun look
silly. The booking's enormous; and it's something
to draw them here, with that Venus-rising-from-the-foam
girl across the Square. I'm told,
too, that she appears to have chosen a beach where
there are no by-laws in force, Andy."</p>

<p>Andy explained that he had not much leisure for
even the most attractive entertainments.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she proceeded, "that something
very funny&mdash;I shan't want you for ten
minutes, Mrs. Milsom" (this to her dresser, who
discreetly withdrew)&mdash;"has happened about Billy
Foot? I don't mind telling you, in confidence,
that at Meriton I thought he was going to break
<a class="pagenum" id="page_450" title="pg 450"></a>
out. With half an opportunity he would have.
Since we came back I've only seen him twice, and
then he tried to avoid me. His usual haunts,
Andy, know him only occasionally, and then in
company which, to my mind, undoubtedly has
its home in Kensington."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him, I wonder?
Now you remind me, I've hardly seen him
either."</p>

<p>"He was here the other night, in a box, with
Kensington; but he didn't come round. Took
Kensington on to supper, I suppose."</p>

<p>"What have you against Kensington?" Andy
inquired curiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. Only I've observed, Andy,
that taking Kensington out is a prelude to matrimony.
I could tell you a dozen cases in my
own knowledge. You hadn't thought of that?
In certain fields my experience is still superior
to yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, very much so! Do you suspect any
particular Kensingtonian?"</p>

<p>"There was a tall dark girl, rather pretty; but
I couldn't look much. Well, we shall miss Billy
if it comes off, but I imagine we can rely implicitly
on Gilly."</p>

<p>"You've heard that Harry's married to Miss
Vintry?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_451" title="pg 451"></a>
"Serve her right!" said the Nun severely. "I
never had any pity for that woman."</p>

<p>"And he's chucked the candidature. So our
great campaign was all for nothing!"</p>

<p>"Well, Billy must always be talking somewhere,
anyhow. And I should think it did you
good?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it did. I was thinking of Harry."</p>

<p>"In my opinion it's about time you got out of
that habit. Now you must go, or you'll make me
too late to get anything to eat. As you may guess,
wearing this shell involves a fundamental reconstruction
before I can present myself at supper."</p>

<p>Andy took her hand and pressed it. "I'm so
jolly glad you've got such a success, Doris. And
the armour's ripping!"</p>

<p>There followed three weeks of what Gilly Foot,
over his lunch at the restaurant and his dinner at
the Artemis, used to describe as "incredible grind
for both of us." Then a day of triumph! The
outcome of the latest brilliant idea, the new scientific
primer, was accepted as the text-book in the County
Council secondary schools. Gilly wore a <i>Nunc
Dimittis</i> air.</p>

<p>"Eton and Harrow! Pooh!" said he. "A
couple of hundred copies a year apiece, perhaps.
Give me the County Council schools! The young
masses being bred on Gilbert Foot and Co.&mdash;that's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_452" title="pg 452"></a>
what I want. The proletariat is our game! If
this spreads over the country, and I believe it will,
we shall be rich men in no time, Andy."</p>

<p>Andy was smiling broadly&mdash;not that he had any
particular wish to be rich, but because successful
labour is marvellously sweet.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember that it was you
who gave me the germ of that idea?"</p>

<p>"No, surely I didn't? I don't remember. I
can't have, Gilly."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you did. That arrangement of the
tables of comparison?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! Yes&mdash;well, I do remember something
about that. But that's only a trifle. You did all
the rest."</p>

<p>"That's what's fetched them, though; I know it
is." He gave a sigh. "Andy, I shall grudge you
that all the rest of my life." He put his head on
one side, and regarded his partner with a peaceful
smile. "You're a remarkable chap, you know.
Some day or other I believe you'll end by making
me work! Sometimes I kind of feel the infection
creeping over me. I distinctly hurried lunch to-day
to come back and talk about this."</p>

<p>"I believe we have got our foot in this time,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>"I shan't, however, do anything more to-day,"
Gilly announced, rising and putting on his hat.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_453" title="pg 453"></a>
"My nerves are somewhat over-stimulated. A
walk in the park, a game of bridge, and a quiet
little dinner are indicated. You'll attend to anything
that turns up, won't you, old chap?"</p>

<p>Slowly and gradually Andy Hayes was growing
not only into his strength but also into the consciousness
of it. He was measuring his powers&mdash;slowly,
suspiciously, distrustfully. His common
sense refused to ignore what he had done and was
doing, but his modesty ever declined to go a step
beyond the facts. All through his life this characteristic
abode with him&mdash;a sort of surprise that the
simple qualities he recognised in himself should
stand him in such good stead, combined with an
unwillingness rashly to pledge their efficacy in the
greater labours of the future. Thus it came about
that he was, so to say, a day behind the world's
estimate in his estimate of himself. When the
people about him were already sure, he was gradually
reaching confidence&mdash;never the imperious
self-confidence of commanding genius, which makes
no question but that the future will be as obedient
to its sway as the past, but a very sober trust in a
proved ability, a trust based on no inner instinct
of power, but solely on the plain experience that
hitherto he had shown himself equal to the business
which came his way&mdash;equal to it if he worked very
hard at it, took it seriously, and gave all he had to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_454" title="pg 454"></a>
give to it. The degree of self-confidence thus
achieved was never sufficient to make him seek
adventures; by slow growth it became enough to
prevent him from turning his back on any task,
however heavy, which the course of his life and
the judgment of his fellows laid upon him. So
step by step he moved on in his development and
in his knowledge of it. He recognised now that it
would have been a pity to pass his life as a butcher
in Meriton&mdash;that it would have been waste of
material. But he was still quite content to regard
as a sufficient occupation, and triumph, of that life
the building-up of Gilbert Foot and Co.'s educational
publishing connection; and he was still
surprised to be reminded that he had contributed
anything more than hard work to that task, that it
owed to him even the smallest scintilla of original
suggestion. Still there it was. Perhaps he would
never do a thing like that again. Very likely not.
Still he had done it once. It passed from the
impossibles to the possibles&mdash;a possible under
strict and distrustful observation, but a possible
that should be put to the proof.</p>

<p>Nothing in the business line turned up after
Gilly had departed to recruit his nerves. Having
made one bold and successful leap, the educational
publishing concern of Gilbert Foot and Co. seemed
disposed to sit awhile on its haunches. Andy was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_455" title="pg 455"></a>
the last man to quarrel with it for that; he had all
the primitive man's fear of things looking too rosy.
Things had looked too rosy with Harry. And
"Nemesis! Nemesis!" old Belfield had cried.
By all means let the educational publishing concern
rest on its haunches for awhile; the new scientific
primer, with the quite original arrangement of its
comparative tables, supplied a comfortable cushion.
It was five o'clock; Andy made bold to light his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Belfield!" announced the office-boy,
twisting his head between the door and the jamb
with a questioning air.</p>

<p>What brought Belfield to town? "Oh, show
him in!" said Andy, laying down his pipe.</p>

<p>Not Harry's father, as Andy had concluded, but
Harry himself was the visitor&mdash;Harry radiantly
handsome, in a homespun suit of delicate gray
with a blue stripe in it, a white felt hat, a light blue
tie&mdash;a look of perfect health and happiness about
him.</p>

<p>"I was passing by&mdash;been in the City&mdash;and
thought I must look you up, old chap," said
Harry, clasping Andy's hand in unmistakably
genuine affection. "Seems years since we met!
Well, a lot's happened to me, you see. You
didn't know I was in town, did you? Only
passing through; Isobel and I have been in Paris&mdash;went
<a class="pagenum" id="page_456" title="pg 456"></a>
there after the event, you know&mdash;and
we're off to Scotland to-morrow for some golf.
She's got all the makings of a player, Andy. And
how are you? Grubbing away?"</p>

<p>"Grubbing away" most decidedly failed to
express Gilbert Foot and Co.'s idea of what had
happened in their office that day, but Andy found
no leisure to dwell on any wound to his firm's
corporate vanity. Here was the old Harry!
Harry as he had been in the early days of his
engagement! The Harry of that brief spell of
good resolution, after Andy had delivered to him
a certain note! There was no trace at all&mdash;by
way either of woe or of shame&mdash;of the Harry who
had come to the Lion, seeking a place where
Isobel Vintry might lay her head, craving for her
the charity of a night's lodging, and no questions
asked!</p>

<p>Andy's intelligence was brought to a full stop&mdash;sheer
up against the difficult question of whether
it is worth while to worry about people who are
not worrying about themselves. Theologically,
socially, politically, it is correct to say yes; faced
with an individual case, the affirmative answer
seems sometimes almost ridiculous; rather like
pressing an overcoat&mdash;or half your cloak, after the
example of St. Martin of Tours&mdash;on a vagabond
of exceptionally caloric temperament. He is
<a class="pagenum" id="page_457" title="pg 457"></a>
naked, and neither ashamed nor cold. Must you
shiver, or blush, for him?</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;ought to congratulate you, Harry."</p>

<p>"Thanks, old chap! Yes, it's very much all
right. Things one's sorry for, of course&mdash;oh,
don't think I'm not sorry!&mdash;but the right road
found at last, Andy! I suppose a fellow has to
go through things like that. I'm not justifying
myself, of course; I know I'm apt to&mdash;well, to
put off doing the necessary thing if it's likely to
cause pain to anybody. That's a mistake, though
an amiable one perhaps. But all that's over&mdash;no
use talking about it. When we get back to town,
you must come and see us."</p>

<p>Andy remembered an old-time conversation
about Lethe water. Harry seemed disposed to
stand treat for a bottle.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry about&mdash;about the seat, Harry,"
he said.</p>

<p>A faint frown of vexation marred Harry's comely
contentment. "Yes, but I don't know that one
isn't best out of it. A lot of grind, making yourself
pleasant to a lot of fools! Oh, perhaps it's a
duty; but it'll wait a bit."</p>

<p>"You're not looking out elsewhere?" Andy
asked.</p>

<p>"Give a fellow time!" Harry expostulated.
"I've only been married a fortnight! You must
<a class="pagenum" id="page_458" title="pg 458"></a>
let me have a bit of a holiday. Oh, you needn't
be afraid I shan't tackle it again soon&mdash;Isobel's
awfully keen! And I hope to find a rather less
dead-alive hole than Meriton." The faint frown
persisted on his face; it seemed to hint that his
mind harboured a grudge against Meriton&mdash;something
unpleasant had happened there. A perceptible,
though slight, movement of his shoulders
dismissed the ungrateful subject. In a moment
he had found a more pleasant one&mdash;a theme for
his kindliness to play on, secure from perturbing
recollections. His old friendly smile of encouragement
and patronage beamed on Andy.</p>

<p>"So you and Gilly are making it go? That's
right! He's a lazy devil, Gilly, but not a fool.
And you're a good plodder. You remember I
always said you'd make your way? I thought
you would, even if you'd taken on old Jack's
shop. But I expect you've got a better game
here. Gilly pleased with you?" He laughed in
his pleasantly conscious impudence.</p>

<p>"He hasn't given me the sack yet," said Andy.</p>

<p>"You did a lot of work for me, old fellow,"
Harry pursued. "Sorry that, owing to circumstances,
it's all wasted! Still it taught you a
thing or two, I daresay?"</p>

<p>"That's just what the Nun was saying the
other night, when I went to see her show."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_459" title="pg 459"></a>
Harry's faint frown showed again. His recollection
of Miss Flower's behaviour at Meriton
accused her of a want of real sympathy.</p>

<p>"Ah yes! I don't know who they'll get; but I
must have made the seat safe. Just the way one
works for another fellow sometimes! It doesn't
do to complain."</p>

<p>The office-boy put his head in again&mdash;and his
hand in front of his head. "Wire just come, sir,"
he said to Andy, delivered the yellow envelope,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Open it, old fellow," said Harry, putting an
exquisitely shod foot on the table. "Yes, another
fellow will take my place; I've done the work,
he'll reap the reward. And he'll probably think
he's done it all himself!"</p>

<p>Andy fingered his telegram absently, not in
impatience; nothing very urgent was to be expected,
the great <i>coup</i> had already been made.
He laid it down and listened again to Harry
Belfield.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," Harry went on, "I rather
envy you your life. A good steady straight job&mdash;and
only got to stick to it. Now I'm no sooner
out of one thing&mdash;well out of it&mdash;than they begin
to kick at me to start another. The pater and
Isobel are in the same story about it."</p>

<p>Harry's face was now seriously clouded and his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_460" title="pg 460"></a>
voice peevish. He had been through a great deal of
trouble lately; he seemed to himself to be entitled
to a rest, to a reasonable interval of undisturbed
enjoyment. And he was being bothered about
that career of his!</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you oughtn't to miss the next
election. The sooner you go in the better, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It's not so easy to find a safe seat." Harry
assumed that the constituency which he honoured
should be one certain properly to appreciate the
compliment. "I sometimes think I'd like to chuck
the whole thing, and enjoy my life in my own
way. Oh, I'm only joking, of course; but when
they nag, I jib, you know."</p>

<p>Andy nodded, relit his pipe, and opened his
telegram.</p>

<p>"That's why I think you're rather lucky to
have it all cut and dried for you. Saves a lot of
thinking!"</p>

<p>Andy had been reading his telegram, not listening
to Harry for the moment. "I beg pardon,
Harry?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, read it. I'm only gassing," said Harry
good-humouredly.</p>

<p>Andy read again; he always liked to read
important documents twice. He laid it down
on the office table, looking very thoughtful.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_461" title="pg 461"></a>
"That's funny!" he observed. "It's from your
father."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see why the pater shouldn't send
you a telegram, if he wants to," smiled Harry.</p>

<p>"Asking me to go down to Meriton on Saturday
and meet Lord Meriton, Wigram, and himself."
He took up the telegram and read the rest of the
message&mdash;"to discuss important suggestion of
public nature affecting yourself. Personal discussion
necessary."</p>

<p>"To meet Meriton and Wigram?" Wigram
was the Conservative agent in the Division.
"What the devil can they want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Andy, "unless&mdash;unless
it's about the candidature."</p>

<p>"About what?" Harry sharply withdrew the
shapely foot from the table and sat upright in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Still I don't
see what else it can be about. What else can there
be of a public nature affecting me? 'Affecting
yourself' doesn't sound as if they only wanted
my advice. Besides, why should they want my
advice?"</p>

<p>"Let's see the thing." Harry took it, read it,
and flung it down peevishly. "Why the deuce
can't he say what he means?"</p>

<p>"Well, a wire's not always absolute secrecy in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_462" title="pg 462"></a>
small towns, is it? And I daresay they'd want
the matter kept quiet till it was settled."</p>

<p>Harry's mood of gay contentment, clouded once
or twice before, seemed now eclipsed. He sat
tapping his boot impatiently with his stick. His
father's telegram&mdash;or Andy's interpretation of it&mdash;clearly
did not please him. In the abstract, of
course, he had known that he would have a successor
in the place which he had given up, or from
which he had fallen. It had never entered his
head that anybody would suggest Andy Hayes,
his old-time worshipper and humble follower.
He was not an ungenerous man, but this idea demanded
a radical readjustment of his estimate of
the relative positions of Andy and himself. If
Andy were to succeed to what he had lost, it
brought what he had lost very sharply before his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, if that is the meaning of it, it certainly
seems rather&mdash;rather a rum start, eh, Andy? New
sort of game for you!" He tried to make his
voice pleasant.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it would be&mdash;awfully kind of them to
think of it," said Andy, now smiling in candid
gratification. "And Wigram, as well as your
father, was highly complimentary about some of
my speeches. But it would be quite out of the
question. I've neither the time nor the money."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_463" title="pg 463"></a>
"It's a deuced expensive game," Harry remarked.
"And, of course, no end of work,
especially in the next few months. And when
you're in, it's not much good in these days, unless
you can give all your time to it."</p>

<p>"I know," said Andy, nodding grave appreciation
of all these difficulties. "It seems to me
quite out of the question. Still, if that is what
they mean, I can hardly refuse to discuss it. You
see, it's a considerable compliment, anyhow."</p>

<p>He was thinking the idea over in his steady way,
and had not paid heed to Harry's altered mood.
The objections Harry put forward were so in tune
with his own mind that it did not strike him as at
all odd that his friend should urge them even
zealously. "In any event," he added, "I should
have to be guided entirely by what Gilly Foot
thought."</p>

<p>"What Gilly thought?"</p>

<p>"I mean whether he thought it would be compatible
with the claims of the business."</p>

<p>"What, you'd really think of it?"</p>

<p>There was such unmistakable vexation, even
scorn, in his voice now that Andy could not
altogether miss the significance of the tone. He
looked across at Harry with an air of surprise.
"There's no harm in thinking a thing over. I
always like to do that."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_464" title="pg 464"></a>
"Well, of all the men I thought of as likely to
step into my shoes, I never thought of you."</p>

<p>"It's the last thing I should ever have thought
of either. You've something in your mind, haven't
you? I hope you'll say anything you think quite
candidly."</p>

<p>"Oh well, since you ask me, old fellow, from
the party point of view I think there are&mdash;er&mdash;certain
objections. I mean, in a place like Meriton
family connections and so on still count for a good
deal&mdash;on our side, anyhow."</p>

<p>Andy nodded, again comprehending and admitting.
"Yes, I'm nobody; and my father was
nobody, from that point of view." He smiled.
"And then there's Jack Rock!"</p>

<p>"Don't be hurt with me, but I call myself a
Tory, and I am one. Such things do count,
and I'm not ashamed to say I think they ought
to. I've never let them count in personal relations."</p>

<p>"I know that, Harry. You may be sure I
recognise that. And you're right to mention
them now. I suppose they must have reckoned
with them, though, before they determined&mdash;if
they have determined&mdash;to make me this offer."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_465" title="pg 465"></a>
"Well, thank heaven I'm out of it, and I wish
you joy of it," said Harry, rising and clapping on
his hat.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not at all likely it'll come to anything.
Must you go, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm off." He paused for a moment.
"If it is what you think, you'd better look at it
carefully. Don't let them persuade you against
your own judgment. I consider Wigram an ass,
and old Meriton is quite out of touch with the
Division." He forbore to comment on his own
father, and with a curt "Good-bye" departed,
shutting the door rather loudly behind him.</p>

<p>This great day&mdash;the day which had both witnessed
the triumph of the new text-book and brought the
telegram from Meriton&mdash;was a Thursday. Andy
sent his answer that he would be at Halton on
Saturday afternoon. He could find no other
possible interpretation of the summons, surprising
as his first interpretation was. He was honestly
pleased; it could not be said that he was much
puzzled. His answer seemed pretty plain&mdash;the
thing was impossible. What did surprise him
rather was the instinctive regret with which he
greeted this conclusion. Such an idea had never
occurred to his mind; when it was presented to
him, he could not turn away without regret&mdash;nay,
not without a certain vague feeling of self-reproach.
If he seemed to them a possible leader, ought he
to turn his back on the battle? But of course
they did not know his private circumstances or the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_466" title="pg 466"></a>
business claims upon him. Harry had been quite
right about those, just as he had been about the
desirability of family connections&mdash;but not of
family connections with Jack Rock.</p>

<p>It was quite out of the question; but, Andy
being human and no more business offering itself,
he indulged in half an hour's reverie over it. He
shook his head at himself with a reproving smile
for this vanity. But it would be pleasant to have
the offer, and pleasant if they let him mention it
to one or two friends. Jack Rock would be proud
of it, and he could not help thinking that perhaps
Vivien Wellgood would be pleased. His brow
knit when he remembered that Harry Belfield had
not seemed pleased. Well, could he be expected
to be pleased? "To step into my shoes" had
been his phrase. Well, if men choose to take off
fine new shoes and leave them lying about?
Somebody will step into them. Why not a friend?
So he argued. A friend in regard to whom
Harry had never allowed anything to interfere
with his personal relations. That was just it.
If a friend, he had also been a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, the recipient
of a kindly generous patronage, an equal by grace
and not by right. Credit Harry Belfield with a
generosity above the average, and yet he might
feel a pang at the idea of his former humble friend
stepping into his shoes, taking his place, becoming
<a class="pagenum" id="page_467" title="pg 467"></a>
successor to what his folly had left vacant. Andy
understood; and from that point of view he felt it
was rather a relief that the thing was in itself an
impossibility. There was a triple impossibility&mdash;the
money, the time&mdash;and Gilly Foot!</p>

<p>Still the text-book and the telegram had given
him an interesting day.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_468" title="pg 468"></a></h2>

<h2>A STOP-GAP.</h2>

<p>Andy felt that he ought not to go to Meriton
without having possessed himself of his
partner's views. Any reluctance&mdash;even a reluctant
assent&mdash;from Gilly would put an immediate end
to the project. He was rather nervous about
bringing the matter forward, fearing lest the mere
idea of it, entertained by the junior partner, might
seem treason in the eyes of his senior in the growing
business of Gilbert Foot and Co.</p>

<p>The interview held one or two surprises for
him. In this affair Andy was to learn the worth
of a band of resolute friends, and to begin to
understand how much men will do for a man who
has convinced them that he can do things for
himself also. For such a man the way is cleared
of all but inevitable difficulties. There is a conspiracy,
partly self-interested, partly based on
appreciation, to set him free to do the work for
which he is fitted; the conspirators both want
<a class="pagenum" id="page_469" title="pg 469"></a>
the work done and are glad to help a fine
worker.</p>

<p>The first surprise was that Gilly Foot was not
at all surprised when Andy put before him a
contingent case&mdash;in terms carefully hypothetical.
Indeed his first words went far to abolish any contingent
or hypothetical character in the discussion.</p>

<p>"So they've done it, have they?" he drawled
out. "I thought they would, from something
Billy said."</p>

<p>"What does Billy know about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Billy knows. I expect they consulted
him, in fact."</p>

<p>"I want to be able to tell them that you agree
with me; that's why I've spoken to you about it."</p>

<p>"By all means tell them I agree with you,"
yawned Gilly; he seemed more than ordinarily
lazy that morning&mdash;the reaction from the triumph
of the text-book still on him, no doubt. Yet there
was a lurking gleam of amusement in his eye.</p>

<p>"Apart from the money&mdash;and I haven't got it&mdash;it
would take far too much time. I'm pretty
hard worked as it is, with the business opening
up in this way. I'm quite clear that it wouldn't
be fair to the business&mdash;and not fair to you either.
I've slept on it, and I'm quite clear about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you? Then by no means tell them
I agree with you."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_470" title="pg 470"></a>
Surprise the second! "You don't?" Andy
ejaculated; there was a note of pleasure in his
voice.</p>

<p>"I'm a lazy hound, I know," Gilly pursued.
"If there is another fellow to do the work, I let
him do it. Perhaps some day, if we go on
booming, we can take in another fellow. If so,
I shall certainly incite him to do the work. Meanwhile
I'm not such a lazy beast as to let you miss
this chance on my account. My word, I should
get it hot from Billy&mdash;and Doris!" He stretched
himself luxuriously. "There's a perfectly plain
way out of this; I must work." He looked up
at his partner humorously. "Though you mayn't
believe it, I can work, when I want a thing very
much."</p>

<p>"But what is there for you to want here?"
asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, we believe in you&mdash;perhaps
we're wrong, but we do. In the second&mdash;and
there's no mistake about this&mdash;we think
you're a good chap, and we want you to have
your chance. I shouldn't forgive myself if I stood
in your way here, Andy&mdash;and the others wouldn't
forgive me either."</p>

<p>Andy was standing by him; he laid his hand
on his shoulder. "You're a good chap yourself,
Gilly."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_471" title="pg 471"></a>
"So, as far as Gilbert Foot and Co. are concerned,
you may consider the matter settled. It's
for you to tackle the other end of it&mdash;the Meriton
end. And since you are here to-day, at all events,
perhaps you won't take it ill if I linger a little
longer than usual over lunch&mdash;for which meal it
seems to me to be nearly time? I feel to-day a
barely perceptible stirring of the brain which,
properly treated, encouraged by adequate nourishment,
might produce an idea. You wouldn't like
to come too?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I've really got more than enough
to do here."</p>

<p>Gilly strolled off, smiling serenely. He was
ready to do himself violence in the way of work
when the time came, but there was really no need
to anticipate matters.</p>

<p>Gilly's knowledge and assent&mdash;it was more than
assent; it was advocacy&mdash;made the project real
and present. Only the question of ways and
means and of his own inclination remained. As
to the latter Andy was no longer able to doubt.
His pleasure at Gilly's attitude was indeed due in
part to the affection for himself which it displayed,
but it had been too eager to be accounted for
wholly by that. His heart rejoiced because Gilly
set him free, so far as the business was concerned,
to follow his desire. Only that little book from
<a class="pagenum" id="page_472" title="pg 472"></a>
the bank still held up its finger in its wonted
gesture of cautious admonition. When it reckoned
the figures involved, the little white book might
be imagined to turn paler still.</p>

<p>At Meriton&mdash;where Andy arranged to spend
the Saturday night with Jack Rock&mdash;the conspiracy
ruled, even as in London. Lord Meriton, Belfield,
and Wigram met him with the air of men
who had already considered and overcome all
difficulties.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Mr. Hayes," said his lordship,
"we were fools over this business, till Foot put
us right. We tried the three or four possible
men in the Division, and for one reason or another
none of them could accept. So, much against my
will&mdash;indeed against my vote; I hate a carpet-bagger&mdash;it
was decided to approach headquarters
and ask for a man. Luckily Belfield wrote first
to Foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Billy Foot wrote back, asking what the
dickens we wanted a man from London for, when
we had the very man for the job under our noses
down here!" He smiled rather sadly. "Meriton
has more than one string to its bow, Andy."</p>

<p>"I've taken every pains to sound opinion, Mr.
Hayes," said Wigram. "It's most favourable.
Your speeches made an excellent impression.
There will be no difficulty in obtaining adoption
<a class="pagenum" id="page_473" title="pg 473"></a>
by the Association, if you come forward under
the proper auspices."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll look after the auspices," said Meriton.
"That'll be all right."</p>

<p>"But I've no influence, no connections, no
standing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We haven't flattered you, Mr. Hayes," Meriton
interrupted, smiling. "We've told you that
we made efforts in other quarters."</p>

<p>"If it pleases you, Andy, you shall regard yourself
as Hobson's choice," said Belfield, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Better than an outsider, anyhow!" Mr. Wigram
chimed in.</p>

<p>Andy's modesty was again defeated. The Jack
Rock difficulty, which had seemed so serious to
Harry Belfield, was acknowledged&mdash;but acknowledged
only to be brushed on one side by a determined
zeal.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I can't possibly afford it!" Andy was
in his last ditch, but then it was a wide and
formidable one. The conspirators, however, attacked
it without the least dismay.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we can get down to business!" said
Belfield in a tone of relief. "This conversation
is, of course, entirely confidential. We've looked
at matters from that point of view, and&mdash;er&mdash;taken
some advice. Wigram here says it can be done
<a class="pagenum" id="page_474" title="pg 474"></a>
comfortably for twelve hundred&mdash;that's two hundred
within the maximum. You needn't shake
your head before I've finished! We think you
ought to put up some of it, and to guarantee a
certain sum annually towards Wigram's expenses.
I'll tell you what we've decided to ask you for&mdash;two-fifty
for the contest, and a hundred a year."</p>

<p>"Now just think it over, Mr. Hayes, and tell
us if you see your way to that."</p>

<p>"But the rest?" asked Andy, half-bewildered;
for the last great ditch looked as if it were being
stormed and crossed. Because&mdash;yes, he might be
able to&mdash;yes, with care, and prosperity at Gilbert
Foot and Co.'s, he could manage that!</p>

<p>Belfield wrote on a bit of paper: "Meriton,
&pound;250; Rock, &pound;250; Belfield, &pound;500." He pushed
it across the table. "That leaves a little margin.
We can easily raise the balance of the annual
expenses."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't possibly&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"My dear Andy, it's constantly being done,"
Belfield expostulated.</p>

<p>"Our friend Belfield, for reasons that you'll
appreciate, feels that he would like to bear a share
of the expenses of this fight, which under&mdash;well,
other circumstances&mdash;would naturally have fallen
entirely on him. My contribution is given for
public reasons, Mr. Hayes, though I'm very glad
<a class="pagenum" id="page_475" title="pg 475"></a>
that it should be of service to you personally."
Meriton broke into a smile. "I expect I needn't
tell you why old Jack Rock's name is there. We
should have got into pretty hot water if we hadn't
let him into it!"</p>

<p>Belfield leant over to Andy, and said in a
lowered voice, "Atonement's too strong a word,
Andy, but I don't want the party to suffer
through anything that's occurred. I don't want
it left in the lurch. I think you'd like to help me
there, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Harry's father was against Harry. Harry's
father urged him to step into Harry's shoes.</p>

<p>"I think we've made you a practical proposition;
it tides us over the next election anyhow, Mr.
Hayes. By the time another Parliament has run
its course, I hope you'll be in a position where
ways and means will present no difficulty. Soon
enough to think about that when the time comes,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"I think I can guarantee you success, Mr.
Hayes," said Wigram.</p>

<p>All the difficulties seemed to have vanished&mdash;if
only he could take the offered help.</p>

<p>"I feel rather overwhelmed," he said slowly.</p>

<p>Meriton shrugged his shoulders. "We must
hold the seat. If you don't let us do this for you
we shall probably have to do it for some fellow
<a class="pagenum" id="page_476" title="pg 476"></a>
we never saw, or else put up with some bounder
who's got nothing to recommend him except his
money. I don't want to press you unduly, Mr.
Hayes, but in my opinion, if your private affairs
don't make it impossible, it's your duty to accept.
Would you like time to consider?"</p>

<p>"Just five minutes, if you don't mind, Lord
Meriton."</p>

<p>Belfield winked at Meriton. If he had asked for
a week! Five minutes meant a favourable answer.</p>

<p>All the factors were before him; they could
be judged in five minutes. It was a venture, but
Meriton said it was his duty. Nobody could tell
where it would lead, but it was honourable work,
for which responsible men thought him fitted. It
was Harry's shoes, but they were empty. That
last thought made him speak.</p>

<p>"If I accept, and win, I hold the seat at the
disposal of those who've chosen me for it." Half-consciously
he addressed himself especially to Belfield.
"If at any time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew you'd feel that way about it; but at
present, at all events, it's not a practical question,
Andy."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful for your confidence," Andy said,
now turning to Meriton. "Since you think me
fit for it, I'll take it and do my best with it,
Lord Meriton."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_477" title="pg 477"></a>
"Capital!" his lordship exclaimed. Wigram's
face was wreathed in smiles. Belfield patted Andy
on the shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>"I don't believe either party to the bargain
will regret it."</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Hayes will have an honourable,
and I believe he will have a distinguished, career,"
Meriton said, and, rising from his chair, broke
up the council.</p>

<p>Andy lingered for a little while alone with
Belfield, to thank him again, to make some
arrangements for the future, to tell him that he
had seen Harry, and that Harry was well and
in good spirits.</p>

<p>"You saw him on Thursday? After you got
my wire? Did you say anything about it?"</p>

<p>"It came while he was there, and I showed it
to him. He was surprised."</p>

<p>"You mean he wasn't pleased?"</p>

<p>"I can understand how he must feel. I feel
just the same thing myself&mdash;terribly strongly sometimes."</p>

<p>Belfield pressed his arm. "You mustn't give
way to that feeling. It's loyal, but it's not reasonable.
Never let that weigh with you in anything."</p>

<p>The feeling might not be reasonable; it seemed
to Andy inevitable. It must weigh with him.
Yet it could not outweigh his natural and legitimate
<a class="pagenum" id="page_478" title="pg 478"></a>
satisfaction that day. His mind reached
forth to the new work, fortified by the confidence
that his friends gave him. The thought of Harry
seemed now rather a sobering reminder that this
thing had come to him, in part at least, by accident.
He was the more bound to do well with it, that
the evil effects of the accident might be minimized.</p>

<p>He made for Jack Rock's house in High Street,
where he was to lodge. Jack had just got off his
horse at the door, and was standing facing his
shop, apparently regarding his sign. Andy came
up and clapped him on the back.</p>

<p>"I know what you've been doing," he said.
"At it again, Jack!"</p>

<p>"You've not refused?"</p>

<p>"No; I've accepted."</p>

<p>Jack wrung his hand hard. "That takes a
weight off my mind," he said with a sigh.</p>

<p>"But it seems a low-down thing to take all
that money&mdash;more of yours too!"</p>

<p>Jack smiled triumphantly. "Well, I happen
to be a bit flush o' cash just now&mdash;that's the truth,
Andy&mdash;so you needn't mind. D'ye see that
sign?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Jack. What's the matter
with it?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a month that sign'll come down."
He cocked his head on one side as he regarded
<a class="pagenum" id="page_479" title="pg 479"></a>
it. "Yes, down in a month! Seems strange,
don't it? Been there sixty year." His sigh
was evenly compounded of sorrow and pride.</p>

<p>"What, are you going to retire, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not pressin' it on you again! Don't
be afraid. To think of my havin' done that!
You as are goin' to Parliament! Lord, it's a
great day, Andy! Come in and have a glass
o' beer." He led the way to his back room, and
the cask was called upon to do its duty. "I've
sold out, Andy," Jack announced. "Sold out
to a concern that calls itself the National, Colonial,
and International Purveyors, Limited. That'll look
well on the sign, won't it? Four thousand pound
they're payin' me, down on the nail, besides pensionin'
off old Simpson. Well, it's worth the
money, if they can do as well with it as I've done.
The house here is thrown in&mdash;they mean to
enlarge the shop."</p>

<p>"But where are you going to set up house,
Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack winked in great enjoyment. "Know of
a certain house where a certain old gentleman
used to live&mdash;him as kept the grammar school&mdash;Mr.
Hayes, B.A. Oxon? The old house in
Highcroft, Andy! It's on the market, and I'm
goin' to buy it&mdash;to say nothin' of a nice range
of stablin' opposite. And there, if you'll accept
<a class="pagenum" id="page_480" title="pg 480"></a>
of 'em, Andy, you'll have your own pair o' rooms
always ready for you, when you're down at
Meriton over your politics. Parlour and bedroom,
there they'll be, and I shan't disturb you.
And when I'm gone, there's the old house for
you. There's nobody poor Nancy would have
been so glad to see in it."</p>

<p>There was a lump in Andy's throat, and he was
not ashamed of it. The regard and love of his
friends seemed to have been very much with him
in the last few days, and to have done great things
for him. Old Jack Rock's affectionate cunning
touched him closely.</p>

<p>"I really think I'm the luckiest beggar alive!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Folks mostly make their luck," said Jack.
"You've made yours. There was no call on
any of us to fret ourselves about you. You
could have gone back to Canada and made your
way for yourself&mdash;if it hadn't been that we got
to want to keep you, Andy." He paused, drank
his beer, and added, "Aye, but I shall feel a bit
strange the day that sign comes down, and I've
no more to say to the meat&mdash;only the horses!
I've lived with the meat, man and boy, nigh on
sixty year."</p>

<p>With a promise to return in good time for
supper&mdash;for no risks must be run with what might
<a class="pagenum" id="page_481" title="pg 481"></a>
be one of the last of Mr. Rock's own joints of
beef that he would ever be privileged to eat&mdash;Andy
left him and took the road to Nutley. He
remembered Vivien's invitation; he looked forward
to telling her his news, the great things that had
been happening to him in the last three days.
But he wanted yet more to meet her again; he
had not seen her since the day after the catastrophe.
Harry he had seen, and Harry had been happy,
in high spirits, quite self-contented, until that
untoward telegram eclipsed his gaiety. Would
the interval of a few brief weeks have wrought
a like change in her? It could not be looked for.
Harry effected such transformations with a celerity
peculiar to himself. Still there was room to hope
for some lightening of her sorrow. Andy hoped
to find it, and would approve of it. His mind
was for the mean, for moderation, in all emotions.
If he resented Harry's gaiety, unending unlifting
woe was hardly more congenial to his temper, and
certainly much more troublesome to deal with tactfully.
Harry's implicit negation of responsibility
had at least the merit of inviting other people not
to make too much of his mischances.</p>

<p>What his changing moods&mdash;his faculty of
emotional oblivion&mdash;did in truth for Harry, pride
effected in outward seeming for Vivien. Some
credit, too, must be given to Wellgood's training
<a class="pagenum" id="page_482" title="pg 482"></a>
and Isobel's able co-operation. The discipline of
the stiff upper lip redeemed some of its harshness
by coming to her rescue now. Never had she
held her head so high in Meriton as in the days
that followed the announcement of Harry Belfield's
marriage with Isobel Vintry. A poor, maimed,
stunted announcement, compared with the column
and a half of description, guests, presents, and
felicitations which would have chronicled her
wedding! Five lines in the corner of the local
paper&mdash;an item of news for such of the population
as did not see the London papers&mdash;it was enough
to make Vivien fence herself about against any
show of pity. To do Meriton justice, it understood
which of the pair had suffered the greater
loss. That Miss Wellgood was "well out of it,"
but that Mr. Harry had "done for himself," was
the prevailing verdict; somewhat affected, it is to
be feared, by the adventitious circumstance that
Isobel was "the companion"&mdash;a drop to obscurity
for brilliant Mr. Harry!</p>

<p>But the marriage dug deeper than to affect mere
seeming. Besides erecting the useful barrier of
impossibility, it raised the fence of an inward pride&mdash;or,
rather, of that fastidiousness which Wellgood
and Isobel had striven to eradicate. In that matter
it was good for Vivien that they had failed. To
allow herself to remember, to muse, to long&mdash;for
<a class="pagenum" id="page_483" title="pg 483"></a>
whom? No more simply for Harry Belfield. In
that name there were allurements for musing and
for longing. But the bearer of it had contracted
for himself now a new designation. It did him
and his memory no good. Isobel Vintry's husband!
The new character did much to strip him of his
romantic habiliments. He was brought down to
earth; he could no more float before the eyes, a
dazzling though unprofitable figure, proceeding in
a brilliant callousness to the wrecking of other
hearts. There is always a touch of the ridiculous
about Don Juan married, or Sir Gawain Light-of-Love
bound in chains in whose forging the Church
has lent a hand to Cupid. And married to Isobel
Vintry, who had stolen kisses behind the door!
In a moral regard perhaps it is sad to say, but we
easier forgive our own romantic wrongs when they
may be supposed to form but a link in a series.
She would have found it harder to despise Harry,
if he had served Isobel after the same fashion as
he had served herself. She knew it not, but
perhaps Harry was entitled to ask her to wait for
just a little while! As the case stood&mdash;to weep for
Isobel's husband! The stiff upper lip which had
been inculcated joined forces with the fastidiousness
that had never been uprooted. She chid herself
for every memory of Harry; every pang of envy
for Isobel demanded from herself a discipline more
<a class="pagenum" id="page_484" title="pg 484"></a>
stern than Isobel's own had ever supplied to meet
Wellgood's theories of a manly training.</p>

<p>Wellgood was proud of his daughter and of his
theories, readily claiming for his system of education
the joint result of its success and of its failure&mdash;of
the courage and of the fastidiousness alike. But
the plague of it was that the thought of the training
brought with it the memory of the preceptress who
had so ably carried out his orders. Wellgood
admired his daughter&mdash;and envied her. He burned
still with a fierce jealousy; for him no appeasement
lay in the marriage.</p>

<p>Yet between Vivien and Andy Hayes silence
about the past could be no more than silence&mdash;merely
a refraining from words, no real forgetfulness,
no true putting aside. For with that past
would go their old relationship to one another;
its roots had grown from that soil, and it flourished
still by the strength of it. At the start their
common memories could envisage no picture
without Isobel's face finding a place on the
canvas; later, Harry was inevitably the central
figure of the composition. If Andy had pitied
and sought to comfort, if Vivien had given confidence
and accepted sympathy, it had always, in
some sort or another, been in regard to one of
these two figures&mdash;in the later days, to both of
them. Still they met, as it were, encumbered by
<a class="pagenum" id="page_485" title="pg 485"></a>
these memories, she to him Isobel's pupil, Harry's
lover, he to her Harry's follower, even though her
own partisan against Isobel. It was hard to get
their relations on to an independent footing; to
be interested in one another for one another's sake,
without that outside reference, which had now
become mere matter of memory&mdash;and best not
remembered; to find in one another and not
elsewhere the motive of their intercourse and
the source of a new friendship. The old kindliness
must be transplanted to a fresh soil if it
were to blossom into a life self-sufficient and
underived.</p>

<p>The line of thought was hers rather than his,
at least more explicit and realized for her than for
him. When he thought of Harry&mdash;or of Isobel
and Harry&mdash;it was with intent to avoid giving
pain by an incautious reference; her mind demanded
a direct assertion that the pair of them were done
with, and that she and he met on the ground of a
new and strictly mutual interest.</p>

<p>She had no thought, no dream, of more than
friendship. The past was too recent, her heart
still too sore. Yet the sore heart instinctively
seeks balm; the wounded flower of pride will
raise its head in grateful answer to a gleam of
sunshine or a drop of rain. Andy's shy surety
that she would rejoice in his luck, because
<a class="pagenum" id="page_486" title="pg 486"></a>
aforetime he had grieved for her tribulation, struck
home to a heart hungry for comradeship.</p>

<p>Thus by her pride, and by her will answering
the call of her pride, she was different. She no
longer merely suffered, was no longer passive to,
kindness or cruelty. He knew the change as soon
as she came to him, in that very room which had
witnessed the first stolen kiss, and, holding her
hand out to him, cried, "Mr. Andy, you've not
refused? There's no welcome for you in this
house if you've refused. Father and I are quite
agreed about it!"</p>

<p>Andy pressed her hand&mdash;Harry would have
kissed it. "You know? I couldn't refuse their
kindness. If I had, yours would have made me
sorry."</p>

<p>"It's good of you to spare time to come and
tell us."</p>

<p>Andy's answer had the compelling power of
unconscious sincerity. "That seemed about the
first thing to do," he said, with a simple unembarrassed
laugh.</p>

<p>The girl blushed, a faint yet vivid colour came
on her cheeks. She drew back a little. Andy's
words were, in their simplicity, bolder far than his
thoughts. Yet in drawing back she smiled. But
Andy had seen the blush. Successful man as he
had now become&mdash;big with promise as he was, at
<a class="pagenum" id="page_487" title="pg 487"></a>
all events&mdash;in this field he was a novice. His
blush answered hers&mdash;and was of a deeper tint.
"I'm afraid that's awfully presumptuous?" he
stammered.</p>

<p>"Why, we've all been waiting to hear the news!
Father had the offer&mdash;you know that? But he
couldn't stand London. Then they asked Mr.
Foot's advice. He said it ought to be you. You
do your best to prevent people thinking of you,
but as soon as you're suggested&mdash;why, it's obvious."</p>

<p>"You really think I shan't make a fool of
myself?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>The delicate flush was still on her cheeks.
"You'll make me very much ashamed of myself
if you do," she answered. "Is my opinion to
be as wrong as all that? Haven't I always trusted
you?"</p>

<p>His surroundings suddenly laid hold on him.
It was the very room&mdash;she stood on the very spot&mdash;where
he had witnessed Harry's first defection,
her earliest betrayal.</p>

<p>"It seems&mdash;it seems"&mdash;he stammered&mdash;"it
seems treason."</p>

<p>She was silent for a minute. The colour glowed
brighter on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I don't care to hear you say that," she told
him, daintily haughty. "I was waiting here to
congratulate you&mdash;yes, I hoped you'd come. I've
<a class="pagenum" id="page_488" title="pg 488"></a>
nothing to do with anybody except the best
candidate! They say you're that. I had my
good wishes ready for you. Will you take them&mdash;without
reserve?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I say things wrong," pleaded poor Andy.
"I'll take anything you'll give."</p>

<p>Her face flashed into a smile. "Your wrong
things are&mdash;well, one can forgive them. It's all
settled then&mdash;and you're to be the M.P.?"</p>

<p>Andy was still apologetic. "They know what
to do, I suppose. It seems curious. Wigram
says it's a certainty too. They've all joined in to
help&mdash;Lord Meriton, Mr. Belfield, and old Jack.
I'm much too poor by myself, you know."</p>

<p>"The man who makes friends makes riches."
She gave a light laugh. "May I be a little bit of
your riches?"</p>

<p>Andy's answer was his own. "Well, I always
remember that morning&mdash;the hunt and Curly."</p>

<p>"I'm still that to you?" she asked quickly, her
colour rising yet.</p>

<p>He looked at her. "No, of course not, but I
had a sort of idea that then you liked me a bit."</p>

<p>She looked across the room at him&mdash;Andy was
a man who kept his distance. "You've been a
refuge in time of trouble," she said. Her voice
was soft, her eyes bright. "We won't talk of the
old things any more, will we?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_489" title="pg 489"></a>
Wellgood stood in the window. "Well, is it
all right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's said yes, father!" she cried with a glad
merriment.</p>

<p>"I thought he would. It's a change for the
better!"</p>

<p>His blunt words&mdash;in truth they were brutal
according to his brutality&mdash;brought silence. Andy
flushed into a painful red&mdash;not for his own sake
only.</p>

<p>"I've got to try to be as good a stop-gap as
I can," he said.</p>

<p>"Something better than that!" Vivien murmured
softly.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV.<a class="pagenum" id="page_490" title="pg 490"></a></h2>

<h2>PRETTY MUCH THE SAME!</h2>

<p>In the spring of the following year Miss Doris
Flower returned from an extensive professional
tour in America. She had enjoyed great success.
The Nun and the Quaker proved thoroughly to
the taste of transatlantic audiences; Joan of Arc
did not at first create the same enthusiasm in the
United States as she had in London, the allusion
to the happier relations between France and
England naturally not exciting quite equal interest.
However an ingenious gentleman supplied the
Maid with a vision of General Lafayette instead;
though not quite so up-to-date, it more than
answered expectations. Across the Canadian
border-line the original vision was, of course, restored,
and went immensely. It was all one to
Miss Flower what visions she had, so that they
were to the liking of the public. She came back
much pleased with herself, distinctly affluent, and
minded to enjoy for awhile a well-earned leisure.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_491" title="pg 491"></a>
Miss Sally Dutton returned with her, charged with
a wealth of comment on American ways and
institutions, the great bulk of which sensible
people could attribute only to the blackest
prejudice.</p>

<p>The lapse of six months is potent to smooth
small causes of awkwardness and to make little
changes of feeling or of attitude seem quite
natural. Billy Foot had undoubtedly avoided the
Nun for the last few weeks before her departure;
he saw no reason now why he should not be
among the earliest to call and welcome his old
friend. It was rather with a humorous twinkle
than with any embarrassment that, when they
settled down to talk, he asked her if she happened
to know the Macquart-Smiths.</p>

<p>"Of Kensington?" asked the Nun in a tone of
polite interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, Kensington Palace Gardens," Billy replied,
tranquilly unconscious of any other than the
obvious bearing of the question. "I thought you
must have heard of them." (The Nun never had,
though she had seen at least one of them.) "The
old man made a pile out in Mexico. They're
very good sort of people."</p>

<p>"You brought one of the girls to hear me one
night, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, she's the only girl, in fact&mdash;Amaranth's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_492" title="pg 492"></a>
her name. Rather silly, but that's
not her fault, is it?" He seemed anxious to forestall
criticism.</p>

<p>"You can call her Amy&mdash;or even Aim&eacute;e," suggested
the Nun consolingly.</p>

<p>Billy laughed. "Have you heard it, or did
you guess, Doris?"</p>

<p>"Guessed it. I can guess any conundrum, however
baffling. I'm awfully glad, Billy. I'm sure
you'll be tremendously happy. When did it
happen&mdash;and when is it going to happen?"</p>

<p>"About a month ago&mdash;and in about three
months' time. Didn't you think her pretty?"</p>

<p>"Very pretty," said the Nun, presuming on a
somewhat cursory inspection of Miss Amaranth.
"And I suppose that since the old man made his
pile&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there are two sons. Still&mdash;yes,
that's all right."</p>

<p>"It all sounds splendid. I don't fall in love
myself, as I've told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that very well," said Billy. "Nobody
knows it better."</p>

<p>Her eyes danced as she shook her head at him
demurely. "But I like to see young people
settling down happily."</p>

<p>"You are rather a queer girl in that way, Doris.
Never feel that way?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_493" title="pg 493"></a>
The Nun considered. "I might go so far as to
admit that I've an ideal."</p>

<p>"Rather a silly thing to have in this world,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Happiness makes you unsympathetic, Billy.
There's no harm in an ideal if you're careful to
keep it as an ideal. Of course if you try to make
it practical there are awful risks."</p>

<p>"And what, or who, is your ideal?"</p>

<p>"'Pray what is that to you?'" the Nun quoted,
under the circumstances rather maliciously. "I
find having an ideal a most comfortable arrangement.
It doesn't worry either him or me&mdash;and
Sally can't possibly object to it. How are things
at Meriton? Andy wrote me his great news, and
of course I never answered. But isn't it
splendid?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to go down lately."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>"But I hear he's doing magnificently. Sure to
get in. But Gilly's the best fun. When Andy
is off electioneering, Gilly works like a horse.
Sandwiches in the office for lunch, with a glass of
sherry from the pub round the corner! I caught
him at it once; he was awfully disgusted."</p>

<p>"Gilly lunching on sandwiches and a glass of
sherry from the pub!" Her voice was full of
wondering amazement.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_494" title="pg 494"></a>
"Yes, he won't hear the last of that in a hurry!
When he did come to lunch the other day, we all
went early and had a nice little pile of ham sandwiches
and a liqueur glass of Marsala ready for
him when he came in. You should have seen his
face&mdash;and not heard his language!" The unnatural
brother laughed. "You see, Andy didn't
want to stand because of neglecting the business,
and Gilly backed himself to take on the work so as
not to stand in Andy's way. And he's doing it."</p>

<p>"But that's awfully fine of Gilly, I think."</p>

<p>"So it is, of course. That's why he gets so
riled when anybody says anything about it."</p>

<p>The Nun nodded in understanding. "And
Harry?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They were abroad or in Scotland all the
winter; came back to town about a month ago.
They've taken a flat in Clarges Street for the
season, I believe."</p>

<p>"Have you been to call on Mrs. Harry Belfield?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, I haven't. I don't know what he
wants. I think I'll leave him to begin. It seems
to be the same old game with him. One sees him
everywhere."</p>

<p>"With her?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes with her. I don't think he's doing
anything about another constituency; seems to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_495" title="pg 495"></a>
have chucked it for the present. But he does
appear to be having a very good time in
London."</p>

<p>"Is he friendly when you meet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's friendly and jolly enough." Billy
smiled. "It's true that he's generally in a hurry.
When I met him with her once, he was in too
much of a hurry to stop!"</p>

<p>"It's very sad, but I'm afraid his memories of
us are not those of unmixed pleasure."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not. Andy says he never goes
down to Meriton."</p>

<p>"Well, really I don't very well see how he
could&mdash;with her!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he and his people have some understanding
about it. One's sorry for them, you
know."</p>

<p>"I think I shall go down to Meriton again this
autumn. Any chance of your being there&mdash;as a
family man?"</p>

<p>"I've promised to speak for Andy, so we may
put in a few days there. Most of the time I shall
have to be preaching to my own flock. I say, will
you come and meet Amaranth?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will. But really I think I should
make it 'Amy'!"</p>

<p>"It's worth considering; but I don't know
how she'll feel about it," said Billy cautiously.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_496" title="pg 496"></a>
"Oh, said in the way you'll say it, it'll sound
sweet," remarked the Nun flippantly.</p>

<p>Billy still looked doubtful; perhaps "Amaranth"
already sounded sweet.</p>

<p>When left alone, Miss Flower indulged herself
for awhile in a reverie of a pensive, hardly melancholy,
character&mdash;not unpleasant, rather philosophical.
Billy Foot's new state was the peg from
which it hung, its theme the balance of advantage
between the single and the married state. It was
in some degree a drawback to the former that
other people would embrace the latter. Old
coteries were thus broken up; old friendships, if not
severed, yet rendered less intimate. New comrades
had to be found, not always an easy task. There
was a danger of loneliness. On the other hand,
there were worse things than loneliness; enforced
companionship, where companionship had become
distasteful, seemed to her distinctly one of
them. Being so very much in another person's
hands also was a formidable thing; it involved
such a liability to be hurt. The balance thus
inclined in favour of the single life, in spite
of its liability to loneliness. The Nun gave
her adhesion to it, with a mental reservation
as to the case of an ideal. And even then&mdash;the
attempt to make it practical? She shook her
head with a little sigh, then smiled. "I wonder
<a class="pagenum" id="page_497" title="pg 497"></a>
if Billy had any idea whom I had in my head!"
she thought.</p>

<p>Sally Dutton came in and found her friend in
this ruminative mood. Doris roused herself to
communicate the news of Billy Foot's engagement.
It was received in Sally's usual caustic manner.
"Came to tell you about it, did he? I wonder
how much he's told her about you!"</p>

<p>"I can't complain if my want of responsiveness
hasn't been emphasised, Sally. You couldn't
expect him to."</p>

<p>"I've been having a talk with Mrs. Harry
Belfield," said Sally, taking off her hat.</p>

<p>This announcement came rather pat on the
Nun's reflections. She was interested.</p>

<p>"Well, how is she? What happened?"</p>

<p>"In my opinion it's just another of them," Sally
pronounced.</p>

<p>Being engaged in shopping at certain "stores"
which she frequented, she had gone into the tea-room
to refresh her jaded energies, and had found
herself at the next table to Isobel. Friendly greetings
had passed; the two had drunk their tea together&mdash;with
other company, as presently appeared.</p>

<p>"What made you think that?" There was no
need to inquire what it was that Sally thought
when she spoke of "another of them;" she did
not refer to ideally successful unions.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_498" title="pg 498"></a>
Sally wrinkled her brow. "She said they'd had
a delightful winter, travelling and so on, and that
she was having a very gay time in London, going
everywhere and making a heap of friends. She
said they liked their flat, but were looking out for
a house. She said Harry was very well and
jolly."</p>

<p>"Well, that sounds all right. What's the
matter, Sally? Not that I pretend to be particularly
anxious for her unruffled happiness. I
don't want anything really bad, of course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Set your mind at ease; she won't be too happy
to please you&mdash;and she knows it." Miss Dutton
considered. "At least she's a fool if she doesn't
know it. Who do you think came in while we
were at tea?"</p>

<p>"Harry?" suggested the Nun, in an obviously
insincere shot at the answer.</p>

<p>"Harry at Harrod's! Mrs. Freere! You remember
Mrs. Freere?&mdash;Mrs. Freere, and a woman
Mrs. Freere called 'Dear Lady Lucy.'" Sally's
sarcastic emphasis on the latter lady's title&mdash;surely
a harmless social distinction?&mdash;was absolutely
savage.</p>

<p>"Did they join you?" asked the Nun, by now
much interested.</p>

<p>"Join us? They swallowed us! Of course
they didn't take much notice of me. They'd never
<a class="pagenum" id="page_499" title="pg 499"></a>
heard of 'Miss Dutton,' and I didn't suppose I
should make a much better impression if I told
them that I lived with you."</p>

<p>"No, of course not, Sally," said the Nun, and
drew up on the edge of an ill-timed gurgle.
"Mrs. Freere's an old story. Who's Lady
Lucy? One of the heap of friends Mrs. Harry
is making?"</p>

<p>"Lady Lucy's young&mdash;younger than Isobel.
Mrs. Freere isn't young&mdash;not so young as Isobel.
Mrs. Freere's the old friend, Lady Lucy's the
new one."</p>

<p>"Did you gather whether Lady Lucy was a
married woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. She referred to 'our money troubles,'
and 'my motor-car.' She's married all right! But
nobody bothered to tell me her name. Well, as I
say, Mrs. Freere's the old friend, and she's the new
friend. They're fighting which of them shall run
the Belfields&mdash;I don't know what else they may
be fighting about! But they unite in sitting on
Isobel. Harry's given her away, I gathered&mdash;told
them what she was before he married her. So, of
course, she hasn't got a chance! The only good
thing is that they obviously hate one another like
poison. In fact I don't think I ever sat at a table
with three women who hated one another more&mdash;though
I've had some experience in that line."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_500" title="pg 500"></a>
"She hates them both, you think? Well, I
shouldn't have thought she was the kind of woman
to like being sat upon by anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's fighting; she's putting up a good
fight for him."</p>

<p>"Well, we know she can do that!" observed
the Nun with a rather acid demureness.</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you to sympathise. I'm just
telling you how it is. 'Harry likes this,' says
Mrs. Freere. 'He always did.' 'Did he, dear?
He tells me he likes the other now,' says Lady
Lucy. 'I don't think he's really fond of either of
them,' says Isobel. 'Oh yes, my dear. Besides,
you must, if you want to do the right thing,' say
both of them. I suppose that, when they once get
her out of the way, they'll fight it out between
themselves."</p>

<p>"Will they get her out of the way? It's rather
soon to talk about that."</p>

<p>"They'll probably both of them be bowled over
by some newcomer in a few months, and Isobel go
with them&mdash;if she hasn't gone already."</p>

<p>"Your views are always uncompromising,
Sally."</p>

<p>"I only wish you'd heard those two women this
afternoon. And, in the end, off they all three
went together in the motor-car. Going to pick up
Harry somewhere!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_501" title="pg 501"></a>
"Rather too much of a good thing for most
men. And it might have been Vivien!"</p>

<p>"It's a woman, and one of God's creatures, anyhow,"
said Sally with some temper.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Nun agreed serenely. "And Mrs.
Freere's a woman&mdash;and so, I presume from your
description, is Lady Lucy. And I gather that they
have husbands? God's creatures too, we may
suppose!"</p>

<p>Sally declined the implied challenge to weigh, in
the scales of an impartial judgment, the iniquities
of the two sexes. Her sympathies, born on the
night when she had given shelter to Isobel at the
Lion, were with the woman who was fighting for
her husband, who had a plain right to him now,
though she had used questionable means to get
him. If Doris asked her to discern a Nemesis in
Isobel's plight&mdash;as Belfield had in the fall of his
too well admired son&mdash;to see Vivien avenged by
Mrs. Freere and Lady Lucy, Sally retorted on the
philosophic counsel by declaring that Doris, a
partisan of Vivien's, lacked human pity for Vivien's
successful rival, whose real success seemed now so
dubious.</p>

<p>Whatever the relative merit of these views, and
whatever the truth as to the wider question of
the iniquities of the sexes, Sally's encounter at least
provided for her friend's contemplation an excellent
<a class="pagenum" id="page_502" title="pg 502"></a>
little picture of the man whose name had been so
bandied about among the three women at the tea-table.
Her dislike of Isobel enabled the Nun to
contemplate it rather with a scornful amusement
than with the hot indignation with which she had
lashed Vivien's treacherous lover. Her feelings
not being engaged in this case, she was able to
regain her favourite attitude of a tolerant, yet open-eyed,
onlooker, and to ask what, after all, was the
use of expecting anything else from Harry Belfield.
What Mrs. Freere&mdash;nay, what prehistoric Rosa
Hinde&mdash;had found out, what Vivien had found
out, what Isobel was finding out, that, in due time,
Lady Lucy would find out also. Perhaps some
women did not much mind finding out. Vivien
had renounced him utterly, but here was Mrs.
Freere back again! And no doubt Lady Lucy
had her own ideas about Mrs. Freere&mdash;besides the
knowledge, shared by the world in general, of the
brief engagement to Vivien and the hurried marriage
with Isobel. Some of them did not mind, or
at least thought that the game was worth the candle.
That was the only possible conclusion. In some
cases, perhaps, they were the same sort of people
themselves; in others, Harry's appeal was too
potent to be resisted, even though they knew that
sorrow would be the ultimate issue.</p>

<p>That was intelligible enough. For the moment,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_503" title="pg 503"></a>
to the woman of the moment, his charm was well-nigh
irresistible. His power to conquer lay in
the completeness with which he was conquered.
He had the name of being a great flirt; in the
exact sense of words, he did not flirt save as a mere
introduction of the subject; he always made love&mdash;to
the woman of the moment. He did not pay
attentions; he was swept into a passion&mdash;for the
woman of the moment. It was afterwards, when
that particular moment and that particular woman
had gone by, that Harry's feelings passed a retrospective
Act by which the love-making and passion
became, and were to be deemed always to have
been, flirtation and attention. Amply accepting
this legislation for himself, and quite convinced of
its justice, he seemed to have power to impose it&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;on others also. And he would
go on like that indefinitely? There seemed no
particular reason why he should stop. He would
go on loving for a while, being loved for a while;
deserting and being despaired of; sometimes, perhaps,
coming back and beginning the process over
again; living the life of the emotions so long as it
would last, making it last, perhaps, longer than it
ought or really could, because he had no other life
adequate to fill its place. The Nun's remorseless
fancy skipped the years, and pictured him, Harry
the Irresistible, Harry the Incorrigible, still pursuing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_504" title="pg 504"></a>
the old round, still on his way from the
woman of the last moment to the woman of the
next; getting perhaps rather gray, rather fat, a
trifle inclined to coarseness, but preserving all his
ardour and all his art in wooing, like a great
singer grown old, whose voice is feeble and
spent, but whose skill is still triumphant over his
audiences&mdash;still convinced that each affair was
"bigger" than any of the others, still persuading
his partner of the same thing, still suffering pangs
of pity for himself when he fell away, still responding
to the stimulus of a new pursuit.</p>

<p>A few days later chance threw him in her way;
in truth it could scarcely be called chance, since
both, returned from their wanderings, had resumed
their habit of frequenting that famous restaurant,
and had been received with enthusiasm by the
presiding officials. Waiting for her party in the
outer room, suddenly she found him standing
beside her, looking very handsome and gay, with a
mischievous sparkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"May I speak to you&mdash;or am I no better than
one of the wicked?" he said, sitting down beside
her.</p>

<p>"You're looking very well, Harry. I hope
Mrs. Belfield is all right?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Isobel's first-rate, thank you. So am
I. How London agrees with a man! I was out
<a class="pagenum" id="page_505" title="pg 505"></a>
of sorts half the time down at Meriton. A country
life doesn't agree with me. I shall chuck it."</p>

<p>"You seemed very well down there&mdash;physically,"
the Nun observed.</p>

<p>"Sleepy, wasn't it? Sleepy beyond anything.
Now here a man feels alive, and awake!"</p>

<p>It was not in the least what he had thought
about Meriton, it was what he was feeling about
Meriton now. He had passed a retrospective Act
about Meriton; it was to be deemed to have been
always sleepy and dull.</p>

<p>"No," he pursued, "when I come into Halton&mdash;I
hope it won't be for a long while&mdash;I think I
shall sell it. I can't settle down as a country
squire. It's not my line. Too stodgy!"</p>

<p>"What about Parliament? Going to find another
place?"</p>

<p>"If I do, it'll be a town constituency. When I
think of those beastly villages! Really couldn't
go through with it again! The fact is, I'm rather
doubtful about the whole of that game, Doris. No
end of a grind&mdash;and what do you get out of it?
More kicks than ha'pence, as a rule. Your own
side doesn't thank you, and the other abuses you
like a pickpocket."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I think you're quite right. Let
it alone."</p>

<p>He turned to her quite eagerly. "Do you
<a class="pagenum" id="page_506" title="pg 506"></a>
really think so? Well, I'm more than half
inclined to believe you're right. Isobel's always
worrying me about it&mdash;talks about letting chances
slip away, and time slip away, and I don't know
what the devil else slip away&mdash;till, hang it, my
only desire is to imitate time and chances, and slip
away myself!" He laughed merrily.</p>

<p>The old charm was still there, the power to
make his companion take his point of view and
sympathise with him, even when the merits were
all against him.</p>

<p>"You see now what it is to give a woman the
right to lecture you, Harry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's kind of her to be ambitious for me,"
said Harry good-naturedly. "I quite appreciate
that. But&mdash;" His eyes twinkled again, and his
voice fell to a confidential whisper. "Well, you've
been behind the scenes, haven't you? My last
shot in that direction has put me a bit off."</p>

<p>It was his first reference to the catastrophe;
she was curious to see whether he would develop
it. This Harry proceeded to do.</p>

<p>"You were precious hard on me about that
business, Doris," he said in a gentle reproach.
"Of course I don't justify what happened. But
my dear old pater and Wellgood pressed matters a
bit too quick&mdash;oh, not Vivien, I don't mean that
for a moment. There's such a thing as making the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_507" title="pg 507"></a>
game too easy for a fellow. I didn't see it at the
time, but I see it now. They had their plan.
Well, I fell in with it too readily. It looked
pleasant enough. The result was that I mistook
the strength of my feelings. That was the
beginning of all the trouble."</p>

<p>Vastly amused, the Nun nodded gravely. "I
ought to have thought of that before I was so down
on you."</p>

<p>He looked at her in a merry suspicion. "I'm
not sure you're not pulling my leg, Doris; but all
the same that's the truth about it. And at any
rate I suppose you'll admit I did the right thing
when&mdash;when the trouble came?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did the right thing then."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you admit that much! I say&mdash;I
suppose you&mdash;you haven't heard anything of Vivien
Wellgood?"</p>

<p>"I hear she's in excellent health and spirits."</p>

<p>"I've never been so cut up about anything.
Still, of course, she was a mere girl, and&mdash;well,
things pass!"</p>

<p>"Luckily things pass. I've no doubt she'll soon
console herself."</p>

<p>"He'll be a very lucky fellow," said Harry
handsomely. After all, he himself had admired
Vivien, and his taste was good.</p>

<p>"He will. In fact I think I know only one
<a class="pagenum" id="page_508" title="pg 508"></a>
man good enough for her&mdash;and that's Andy
Hayes."</p>

<p>Harry's face was suddenly transformed to a
peevish amazement.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, are you out of your mind?
Don't say such silly things! Old Andy's a good
chap, but the idea that Vivien would look at him!
He's not her class; and she's the most fastidious
little creature alive&mdash;as dainty and fastidious as can
be!" He smiled again&mdash;probably at some reminiscence.</p>

<p>"I don't see why her being fastidious should
prevent her liking Andy."</p>

<p>Harry broke into open impatience. "I like old
Andy&mdash;well, I think I've done something to prove
that&mdash;but, upon my soul, you all seem to have gone
mad about him. You all ram him down a man's
throat. It's possible to have too much of him,
good fellow as he is. He and Vivien Wellgood!
Well, it's simply damned ridiculous!" He took
out his watch and, as he looked at it, exclaimed
with great irritation, "Why the devil doesn't this
woman come?"</p>

<p>"I thought Mrs. Belfield was always so
punctual?"</p>

<p>"It's not Mrs. Belfield," Harry snapped out.</p>

<p>"Well, don't be disagreeable to the poor woman
simply because I said something you didn't like."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_509" title="pg 509"></a>
"Something I didn't like? That's an absurd
way of putting it. It's only that to be for ever
hearing of nobody but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That tall young woman over there seems to be
staring rather hard at you and me, Harry."</p>

<p>"By gad, it is her! I must run." His smiles
broke out again. "I say, Doris, I shall get into
trouble over this! You're looking your best, my
dear, and she's as jealous as&mdash;I must run!
Au revoir!"</p>

<p>"It's not Mrs. Freere&mdash;so I suppose it's Lady
Lucy," thought the Nun. She was in high good
temper at the result of her casual allusion to Andy
Hayes. The shoe pinched there, did it? She
was not vicious towards Harry; she wished him no
harm&mdash;indeed she wished him more good than he
would be likely to welcome&mdash;but the extreme
complacency of his manner in the earlier part of
their talk stirred her resentment. Her suggestion
about Andy Hayes put a quick end to
that.</p>

<p>Lady Lucy had an impudent little face, with an
impudent little turned-up nose. She settled
herself cosily into her chair on the balcony and
peeled off her gloves.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad we're just by ourselves&mdash;I mean,
since poor Mrs. Belfield wasn't well enough to
come. I was afraid of finding Lily Freere!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_510" title="pg 510"></a>
"What made you afraid of that?" asked Harry,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, she is about with you a good deal, isn't
she? Does your wife like being managed so
much? Or is it your choice?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Freere's an old friend."</p>

<p>"So I've always understood!"</p>

<p>"You mustn't listen to ill-natured gossip. Just
an old friend! But it's not very likely I should
have asked her to come to-day."</p>

<p>The Nun and her party entered, and sat down at
the other end of the balcony.</p>

<p>"There's that girl you were talking to. Look
round; she's sitting facing me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Doris Flower!"</p>

<p>"An old friend too? You seemed to be having
a very confidential conversation at least."</p>

<p>"On the most strictly unsentimental footing.
Really there you may believe me!" Harry's
voice fell to an artistic whisper. "Did you come
only to tease me?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you care much whether I tease
you or not," said Lady Lucy.</p>

<p>He was helping her to wine; he held the
bottle, she held the glass. Somehow it chanced
that their hands touched. Lady Lucy blushed a
little and glanced at Harry. "How shall I
persuade you that I care?" asked Harry.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_511" title="pg 511"></a>
The Nun's host&mdash;at the other end of the balcony&mdash;turned
to her. "You're not very talkative
to-day, Miss Doris!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry: There's always so much to
look at at the other tables, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much the same old lot!" remarked the
host&mdash;an experienced youth.</p>

<p>"Pretty much!" agreed the Nun serenely.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXV.<a class="pagenum" id="page_512" title="pg 512"></a></h2>

<h2>THE LAST FIGHT.</h2>

<p>On a fine Sunday evening in the following
autumn Belfield and Andy Hayes sat over
their wine, the ladies having, as usual, adjourned
to the garden. Among their number were included
the Nun and Sally Dutton; a second stay at Meriton
had broken down Sally's shyness. Belfield and
his wife were just back from London, whither they
had gone to see their grandchild, Harry's first-born
son. All had gone well, and Belfield was full of
impressions of his visit. His natural pleasure in
the birth of the child was damped by Harry's refusal
to promise to take up his residence at Halton when
his turn came.</p>

<p>"But I did get him to promise not to sell&mdash;only
to let; so his son may live here, though mine
won't." He looked older and more frail; his
mind moved in a near future which, near as it
was, he would not see.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think," he went on, "that the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_513" title="pg 513"></a>
professional moralists, all or most of our preachers
of one sort and another&mdash;and who doesn't preach
nowadays?&mdash;take too narrow a view. Their table
of virtues isn't comprehensive enough. Now my
boy Harry, with all his faults, is never disagreeable.
What an enormous virtue! Negative, if you like,
but enormous! What a lot of pain and discomfort
he doesn't give! All through this domestic business
his behaviour has been admirable&mdash;so kind,
so attentive, so genuinely concerned, so properly
gratified. Upon my word, seeing him in his own
home, you'd think he was a model! That's a
good deal. His weakness comes in to save him
there; he must be popular&mdash;even in his own
house!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this event'll do them no end of good, sir,"
said Andy, ever ready to clutch again at the elusive
skirts of optimism.</p>

<p>"Some, no doubt," Belfield cautiously agreed.
"And she's a brave woman&mdash;I'll say that for her.
She understands him, and she loves him. When
I saw her, we had a reconciliation on that basis.
We let the past alone&mdash;I wasn't anxious to meet
her on that ground&mdash;and made up our minds to
the future. Her work is to keep things going, to
prevent a smash. She must shut her eyes sometimes&mdash;pretty
often, I'm afraid. He'll always be
very pleasant to her, if she'll do that. In fact, the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_514" title="pg 514"></a>
worse he's behaving the pleasanter the rogue will
be. I know him of old in that."</p>

<p>"Has he any plans?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>Belfield smiled. "Oh yes. He's got a plan for
wintering in Algeria; they'll go as soon as she's
well enough, stopping in Paris <i>en route</i>. Yes, he's
really full of plans&mdash;for enjoying himself and meeting
friends he likes. There's a Lady Lucy Somebody
who's got the finest motor-car on earth. She's
going to be in Paris. Oh, well, there it is! Plans
of any other sort are dropped. He's dropped
them; she's had to drop them&mdash;after a good deal
of fighting, so she told me. He makes no definite
refusals; he puts her off, laughs it off, shunts it,
you know, and goes on his own way. One didn't
understand how strong that had grown in him&mdash;the
dislike of any responsibilities or limits. Being
answerable to anybody seems to vex him. I think
he even resents our great expectations, though we
go out of our way to let him see that we've honestly
abandoned them! A pleasant drifting over summer
seas, with agreeable company, and plenty of variety
in it! That's the programme. We shall probably
be wise to add a few storms and a good many minor
squalls to get a true idea of it."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to lead to much."</p>

<p>"Oh, the mistake's ours! For many men I
say nothing against the life. I'm not one of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_515" title="pg 515"></a>
preachers, and there's something to be said for it
for some people. We made our own idol, Andy;
it's our fault. We saw the capacities, we didn't
appreciate the weakness. I can't be hard on poor
old Harry, can you? We parted capital friends,
I'm glad to say&mdash;though he was distinctly in a
hurry to keep an appointment at a tea-shop.
Somebody passing through London, he said&mdash;and
through his fancy too, I imagine." He looked
across at Andy. "I suppose it all seems uncommon
queer to you, Andy?"</p>

<p>"It's a bit of a waste, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"So we think, we at Meriton. That's our old
idea, and we shan't get over it. Yes, a bit of a
waste! But it's nature's way, I suppose. A fine
fabric with one unsound patch! It does seem a
waste, but she's lavish; and the fabric may be very
pleasing to the eye all the same, and serve all right&mdash;so
long as you don't strain it!"</p>

<p>In the garden Mrs. Belfield discoursed placidly
to Miss Doris Flower; it was perhaps fortunate
that the veil of night rendered that young lady's
face hard to read.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, we must let bygones be bygones.
I took a very strong view, a stronger view than I
generally take, of her conduct down here&mdash;though
I can't acquit Mr. Wellgood of a large part of the
blame. But now she's trying to be a good wife to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_516" title="pg 516"></a>
him, I'm sure she is. So I made up my mind to
forgive her; it's a very fine boy, and like my
family, I think. As for the politics and all that,
I'm sure Harry is right, and his father is wrong to
regret his withdrawal. Harry is not fit for that
rough work; both his mind and his feelings are
too fine and sensitive. I hope he will be firm and
keep out of it all. Mr. Hayes is much more fit
for it, much coarser in fibre, you know, dear Miss
Flower; and though, of course, we can't expect
from him what we did from Harry&mdash;if only his
health had stood it&mdash;Mr. Wigram tells me he is
doing really very well. The common people like
him, I understand. Oh, not in the way they
thought of Harry! That was admiration, almost
worship, my dear. But they think he understands
them, and naturally they feel on easy terms with
him. His stepmother was an excellent woman,
and I'm sure we all respect Mr. Rock. Of course
in my young days he'd never have done for a
county member; but we must move with the times,
and I'm really glad that he's got this chance."</p>

<p>The Nun listened to the kindly patronizing old
dame in respectful silence. It was really a good
thing that she could look at the matter like that&mdash;evidently
aided by the fine boy and the fine boy's
likeness to her family. It was hard to grudge
Harry his last worshipper; yet Miss Flower's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_517" title="pg 517"></a>
smile had not been very sympathetic under the
veil of night.</p>

<p>"Of course there's poor Vivien&mdash;such a sweet
girl, and so nice to us! She's never let it make
any difference as far as we're concerned. I am
sorry for her, and her father's very wrong in keeping
her all alone there at Nutley to brood over it.
He ought to have given her a season in London
or taken her abroad&mdash;somewhere where she could
forget about it, and have her chance. What chance
has she of forgetting Harry here at Meriton?"</p>

<p>"You can never tell about that, can you, Mrs.
Belfield? These things happen so oddly."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, my dear, the poor child never sees
anybody! Now you see quite a number of young
men, I daresay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a number, Mrs. Belfield," the Nun
admitted demurely.</p>

<p>"She sees absolutely nobody, except Mr. Hayes
and Mr. Gilly Foot. I don't think she's very likely
to be taken with Mr. Gilly Foot! Oh no, my dear,
it's a sad case."</p>

<p>"You ought to talk to Mr. Wellgood about
it."</p>

<p>"I never talk to Mr. Wellgood at all now, my
dear, if I can help it. I don't like him, and I think
his attitude has been very hard&mdash;quite unlike dear
Vivien's own! Well, Harry did no more than
<a class="pagenum" id="page_518" title="pg 518"></a>
hint at it, and Isobel, of course, said nothing; but
we may have our own opinions as to whether it's
all for Vivien's sake!" Mrs. Belfield almost
achieved viciousness in this remark. "And&mdash;it
may seem selfish of me to say it&mdash;if she married
and went away, Harry might be more inclined to
come down here. As it is, he feels it would be
awkward. He's so sensitive!"</p>

<p>Belfield and Andy came out&mdash;the old man
muffled in shawls and, even so, fearing his wife's
rebuke, Andy drawing the fresh air eagerly into
his lungs. He had dined for the first time since
the Sunday before; the miles he had covered, the
speeches he had made, defied calculation. He had
hardly any voice left. His work was nearly done;
the polling was on the morrow. But he was due
in a neighbouring constituency the day after that&mdash;for
one more week. Then back to Gilbert Foot
and Co., to make up arrears. Surveying the work
he had done and was about to do, he rejoiced in
his strength, as formerly he had rejoiced to follow
Lord Meriton's hounds on his legs and to anticipate
the fox's wiles.</p>

<p>He sat down by Mrs. Belfield. Vivien and
Sally, who had been strolling, joined the group,
of which he made the centre.</p>

<p>"Yes, it looks all right," he said, continuing
his talk with Belfield. "Wigram promises me a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_519" title="pg 519"></a>
thousand. A strong candidate would get that. I
hope for about six hundred."</p>

<p>"You think it's safe, though, anyhow?" asked
Vivien.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it's safe." He broke into a
laugh. "If anybody had told me this!"</p>

<p>They discussed the fight in all its aspects,
especially the last great meeting in the Town Hall
the night before. The Nun mimicked Andy's
croaking notes with much success, and Miss
Dutton commented on popular institutions with
some severity. They were full of excitement as
to the morrow, when the three girls meant to
follow Andy's progress through the Division.
Mrs. Belfield gave tokens of an inclination to
doze. Belfield sat listening to the girls' voices, to
their eager excited talk, and their constant appeals
to the hero of the day.</p>

<p>The hero of the day! It was Andy Hayes, son
of old Mr. Hayes of the Grammar School, <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>,
for his stepmother's sake, of Jack Rock the butcher.
He had nearly gone back abroad in failure; he had
nearly taken on the shop. He stood now the
winner in the fight, triumphant in a contest which
he had never sought, from the idea of which he
would have shrunk as from rank folly and rank
treason. Into that fight he had been drawn unconsciously,
insensibly, irresistibly, by another
<a class="pagenum" id="page_520" title="pg 520"></a>
man's doings and by his own, by another man's
character and by the character that was his. His
conscious part had always been to help his adversary;
his adversary unconsciously worked all the
while for him. What his adversary had bestowed
in ready kindness stood as nothing beside what he
had given unwittingly, by accident, never thinking
that the results of what he did would transcend
the limits of his own fortunes, and powerfully
mould and shape another's life. Whom Andy
loved he had conquered; whom he followed he
had supplanted. The cheers and applause which
had rung out for him last night had, a short year
ago, been the property of another. His place was
his by conquest.</p>

<p>So mused Belfield, father of the vanquished, as
he sat silent while the merry voices sounded in his
ears. A notable example of how each man finds
his place, in spite of all the starts, or weights, or
handicaps with which he enters on the race! These
things tell, but not enough to land an unsound
horse at the post before a sound one. The
unsound falters; slowly and surely the sound
lessens the gap between them. At last he takes
the lead. Then the cry of the crowd is changed,
and he gallops on to victory amidst its plaudits.
Jack Rock had made no mistake when he entered
his horse and put up the stakes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_521" title="pg 521"></a>
The hero of that day, the victor in that fight,
yes! Against his wishes, without premeditation,
so he stood. There was another day of strife,
another fight to be waged, one that could not be
unmeant or unconscious. Here the antagonism
must come into the open, must be revealed to the
mind and heart of the fighter. Here he must not
only follow, he must himself drive out; he must
not only supplant, he must strive to banish, nay,
to annihilate. There was a last citadel which,
faithful to faithlessness and true against desertion,
still flew the flag of that loved antagonist. Would
the flag dip and the gates open at his summons?
Or would the response to his parley be that, though
the faithless might be faithless, yet the faithful
must be faithful still? Before that answer his arm
would be paralyzed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure you'll deserve your success,
Mr. Hayes," said Mrs. Belfield, rising and preparing
to retreat indoors. "I hear you've worked very
hard and made an extremely good impression."</p>

<p>A quiet smile ran round the circle. The speech,
with its delicate, yet serenely sure, patronage would
have sounded so natural a year before. In the
darkness Andy found himself smiling too. A
sense of strength stirred in him. The day for encouragement
was past; he did not need it. Save
for that last citadel! There still he feared and

<a class="pagenum" id="page_522" title="pg 522"></a>
shrank. With his plain mind, in his strenuous
days, he had done little idealising. Only two
people had he ever treated in that flattering exacting
fashion. His idealising stood in his path now.
The weak spot of his sturdy common-sense had
always been about Harry; it was so still, and he
had an obstinate sense of trying to kick his old
idol, now that it was overthrown. And for her&mdash;how
if his approach seemed a rude intrusion, the
invasion of a desolate yet still holy spot, sacrilege
committed on a ruined shrine? On the one side
was Harry, or the memory of Harry, stronger
perhaps than Harry himself. On the other he
himself stood, acutely conscious of his associations
for her, remembering ever the butcher's shop,
recollecting that what favour he had won had been
in the capacity of a buffer against the attack of
others. How if the buffer, forsaking its protective
function, encroached on its own account?</p>

<p>Yet in the course of the months past they had
grown into so close a friendship, so firm an alliance.
On his part there had been no wooing, on hers
neither coquetry nor sentiment displayed. To
Harry Belfield their relations to each other would
have appeared extremely dull, unpermissibly stagnant,
reflecting no credit on the dash of the man
or the sensibility of the lady. Sally Dutton,
suspecting Andy's hopes, had a caustic word of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_523" title="pg 523"></a>
praise for his patience&mdash;the sort of remark which,
repeated to Harry about himself, would have sent
him straight off to a declaration (the like had
happened once by the lake at Nutley). But
through these long days, as Andy came and went
on his twofold work, from Division to business,
from business to Division, they had become
wonderfully necessary to one another. For her
not to expect him, for him not to find her, would
have taken as it were half the heart out of life.
Who else was there? Vivien had drawn a little
nearer to that dour father of hers, but nearness to
him carried the command for self-repression, for
reticence. Andy seemed to have no other with
whom to talk of himself and his life, as even the
strongest feel a craving to talk sometimes. Perhaps
there was one other ready to serve. He did
not know it; she ranked for him among the
cherished friends of his lighter hours. He craved
an intimate companionship for the deeper moments,
and seemed to find it only in one place.</p>

<p>At his own game, his speciality, Harry Belfield
could give away all the odds, and still be a formidable
opponent. The incomparable love-maker
could almost overcome his own treasons; he left
such a memory, such a pattern. Isobel loved still;
Mrs. Freere was ready to come back; Lady Lucy
owned to herself that she was in danger of being
<a class="pagenum" id="page_524" title="pg 524"></a>
very silly. Even the Nun was in the habit of
congratulating herself on a certain escape, with the
implication that the escape was an achievement.
To resist him an achievement! To forget him&mdash;what
could that be? To Andy it seemed that for
any woman it must be an impossibility. In the
veiled distance of Vivien's eyes, when the talk
veered towards her unfaithful lover, he could find
no dissent. Was oblivion a necessity? Here he
was&mdash;in Harry's place. Did he forget?</p>

<p>They let him rest&mdash;with his thoughts; they saw
that the big fellow was weary. The old Belfields
conducted one another into the house; Vivien took
Sally off again with her. Only Doris Flower sat
on by him, silent too, revolving in her mind the
chronicles of Meriton, the little town with which
her whim had brought her into such close touch,
from which she was not now minded wholly to
separate herself. It seemed like an anchorage in
the wandering sea of her life. It offered some
things very good&mdash;a few firm friends, a sense of
home, a place where she was Doris Flower, not
merely the Nun, the Quaker, or Joan of Arc. Did
she wish that it offered yet more? Ah, there she
paused! She was a worker born, as Andy himself
was. No work for her lay in Meriton. Perhaps
she desired incompatibles, like many of us; being
clear-eyed, she saw the incompatibility. And she
<a class="pagenum" id="page_525" title="pg 525"></a>
was not subjected to temptation. She was taken
at the valuation which she so carefully put on
herself&mdash;the good comrade of the lighter hours.
No cause of complaint then? None! She did
not cry, she did not fall in love. She did not break
her records. There is small merit in records unless
they are hard to make, and sometimes hard to
keep.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand and laid it on his
arm. He turned to her with a start, roused from
his weariness and his reverie.</p>

<p>"Dear Andy, have you learnt what we have, I
wonder? Not yet, I expect!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Doris?"</p>

<p>"Trust in you. A certainty that you'll bring it
off!" She laughed&mdash;a little nervously. "I've a
professional eye for a situation. Try for a double
victory to-morrow! Make a really fine day for
yourself&mdash;one to remember always!" She drew
her hand away with another nervous laugh; her
clear soft voice had trembled.</p>

<p>Andy's inward feelings leapt to utterance.
"Have you any notion of what I feel? I&mdash;I'm
up against him in everything! It's almost uncanny.
And I think he'll beat me in this. At
least I suppose you mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean that." Her voice was calm again, a
little mocking. "But I shall say no more about it."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_526" title="pg 526"></a>
Andy pressed her hand. "I like to have your
good wishes more than anybody's in the world,"
he said, "unless, perhaps, it were his, Doris. Don't
say I told you, but he grudges me the seat. He'd
grudge me the other thing worse, much worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's quite morbid. It's all his own
fault."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. But he's never been to you
what he has to me." He smiled. "We at
Meriton still have to please Harry, and to have
him pleased with us. The old habit's very strong."</p>

<p>"Heavens, Andy, you wouldn't think of sacrificing
yourself&mdash;and perhaps her&mdash;to an idea like
that?"</p>

<p>"No, that would be foolish, and wrong&mdash;as
you say, morbid. But it can't be&mdash;whatever she
says to me&mdash;it can't be as if he had never existed&mdash;as
if it all hadn't happened."</p>

<p>"Some people feel things too little, some feel
them too much," the Nun observed. "Both bad
habits!"</p>

<p>"I daresay the thing's a bit more than usual
on my mind to-night&mdash;because of to-morrow, you
know." He was silent for a moment; then he
broke into one of his simple hearty laughs. "And
I am such an awful duffer at making love!"</p>

<p>"You certainly have no great natural talent
for it and, as you've told me, very little practice.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_527" title="pg 527"></a>
Oh, I wonder how big your majority will be,
Andy!"</p>

<p>Andy readily turned back to the election. Yet
even here the attitude she had reproved in him
seemed to persist. "I expect, as I said, about
six hundred. Harry would have got a thousand
easily."</p>

<p>Andy escorted Vivien back to Nutley. He
had it in mind to speak his heart&mdash;at least to
sound her feeling for him; but she forestalled his
opening.</p>

<p>"Mr. Belfield's been talking to me about Harry
to-night, for the first time. He wrote me a letter
once, but he has never spoken of him before.
He was rather pathetic. Oh, Andy, why can't
people think what they are doing to other people?
And poor Isobel&mdash;I'm afraid she won't be happy.
I used to feel very hard about her. I can't any
more, now that the little child has come. That
seems to make it all right somehow, whatever has
happened before. At any rate she's got the best
right now, hasn't she?" She was silent a moment.
"It was like this that I came home with him that
last evening. He was so gay and so kind. Then&mdash;in
a flash&mdash;it happened!"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about him too to-night.
It seemed natural to do it&mdash;over this election."</p>

<p>They had reached Nutley, but Andy pleaded
<a class="pagenum" id="page_528" title="pg 528"></a>
for a walk on the terrace by the lake before she
bade him good-night.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I know what you must feel,
because you loved him. I loved him, and I feel
it too. But we must neither of us think about
it too much. Because it's no use. What Mr.
Belfield told me makes it quite clear that it's no
use." She spoke very sadly. They had not to
do with an accident or an episode; they had to
recognise and reckon with the nature of a man.
"When once we see that it's no use, it seems to
me that there's something&mdash;well, almost something
unworthy in giving way to it." She turned round
to Andy. "At least I don't want you to go on
doing it. You've made your own success. Take
it whole-heartedly, Andy; don't have any regrets,
any searchings of heart."</p>

<p>"There may be other things besides the seat at
Meriton that I should like to take. When I
search my heart, Vivien, I find you there."</p>

<p>Through the darkness he saw her eyes steadily
fixed on his.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Andy, I wonder! Or is it only
pity, only chivalry? Is it the policeman again?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it be the policeman?" he
asked. "Is it nothing if you think you could
feel safe with me?"</p>

<p>"So much, so much!" she murmured. "Andy,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_529" title="pg 529"></a>
I'm still angry when I remember&mdash;still sore&mdash;and
angry again with myself for being sore. I oughtn't
still to feel that."</p>

<p>"You'd guessed my feelings, Vivien? You're
not surprised or&mdash;or shocked?"</p>

<p>"I think I've known everything that has been
in your heart&mdash;both about him and about me.
No, I'm not surprised or shocked. But&mdash;I
wonder!" She laughed sadly. "How perverse
our hearts are&mdash;poor Harry's, and poor mine!
And how unlucky we two should have hit on
one another! That for him it should be so easy,
and for me so sadly difficult!"</p>

<p>"I won't ask you my question to-night," said
Andy.</p>

<p>"No, don't to-night." She laid her hand on
his arm. "But you won't go away altogether,
will you, Andy? You won't be sensible and firm,
and tell me that you can't be at my beck and call,
and that you won't be kept dangling about, and
that if I'm a silly girl who doesn't know her own
luck I must take the consequences? You'll go
on being the old Andy we all know, who never
makes any claims, who puts up with everybody's
whims, who always expects to come last?" Her
voice trembled as she laughed. "You won't upset
all my notions of you, because you've become a
great man now, will you, Andy?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_530" title="pg 530"></a>
"I don't quite recognise myself in the picture,"
said Andy with a laugh. "I thought I generally
stood up for myself pretty well. But, anyhow,
I've no intention of going away. I shall be there
when&mdash;I mean if&mdash;you want me."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand; he gripped it warmly.
"You're&mdash;you're not very disappointed, Andy?
Oh, I hate to cloud your day of triumph to-morrow!"
Her voice rose a little, a note almost
of despair in it. "But I can't help it! The old
thing isn't gone yet, and, till it is, I can do
nothing."</p>

<p>Andy raised the hand he held to his lips and
kissed it lightly. "I see that I'm asking for an
even bigger thing than I thought," he said gently.
"Don't worry, and don't hurry, my dear. I can
wait. Perhaps it's too big for me to get at all.
You'll tell me about that at your own time."</p>

<p>They began to walk back towards the house,
and presently came under the light of the lamp
over the hall door. Her face now wore a troubled
smile, amused yet sad. How obstinate that
memory was! It was here that Harry had given
her his last kiss&mdash;here that, only a few minutes
later, she had seen him for the last time, and
Isobel Vintry with him! Their phantoms rose
before her eyes&mdash;and the angry shape of her father
was there too, denouncing their crime, pronouncing
<a class="pagenum" id="page_531" title="pg 531"></a>
by the same words sentence of death on the young
happiness of her heart.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Andy," she said softly. "And
a great triumph to-morrow. Over a thousand!"</p>

<p>A great triumph to-morrow, maybe. There
was no great triumph to-night, only a long hard-fought
battle&mdash;the last fight in that strangely-fated
antagonism. Verily the enemy was on his own
ground here. With everything against him, he
was still dangerous, he was not yet put to the
rout. The flag of the citadel was not yet dipped,
the gates not opened, allegiance not transferred.</p>

<p>Andy Hayes squared his shoulders for this last
fight&mdash;with good courage and with a single mind.
The revelation she had made of her heart moved
him to the battle. It was a great love which
Harry had so lightly taken and so lightly flung
away. It was worth a long and a great struggle.
And he could now enter on it with no searchings
of his own heart. As he mused over her words,
the appeal of memory&mdash;of old loyalty and friendship
grew fainter. Harry had won all that, and
thrown all that away&mdash;had been so insensible to
what it really was, to what it meant, and what it
offered. New and cogent proof indeed that he
was "no good." The depths of Vivien's love
made mean the shallows of his nature. He must
go his ways; Andy would go his&mdash;from to-morrow.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_532" title="pg 532"></a>
With sorrow, but now with clear conviction, he
turned away from his broken idol. From the lips
of the girl who could not forget his love had
come Harry's final condemnation. The spell
was broken for Andy Hayes; he was resolute
that he would break it from the heart of Vivien.
Loyalty should no more be for the disloyal, or
faith for the faithless. There too Andy would
come by his own&mdash;and now with no remorse. At
last the spell was broken.</p>

<p>But no double victory to-morrow! The loved
antagonist retreated slowly, showing fight. The
next day gave Andy a victory indeed, but did not
yield the situation which the Nun's professional
eye had craved for its satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVI.<a class="pagenum" id="page_533" title="pg 533"></a></h2>

<h2>TALES OUT OF SCHOOL FOR ONCE.</h2>

<p>The inner circle of Andy Hayes' friends, who
were gradually accustoming themselves to
see him described as Mr. Andrew Hayes, M.P.,
included some of a sportive, or even malicious,
turn of wit. It cannot be denied that to these the
spectacle of Andy's wooing&mdash;it never occurred to
him to conceal his suit&mdash;presented some material
for amusement. All through his career, even
after he had mounted to eminences great and
imposing, it was his fate to bring smiles to the lips
even of those who admired, supported, and followed
him. To the comic papers, in those later
days when the Press took account of him, he was
always a slow man, almost a stupid man, inclined
to charge a brick wall when he might walk round
it, yet, when he charged, knocking a hole big
enough to get through. For the cartoonists&mdash;when
greatness bred cartoons, as by one of the
world's kindly counterbalances it does&mdash;he was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_534" title="pg 534"></a>
always stouter in body and more stolid in countenance
than a faithful photograph would have
recorded him. The idea of him thus presented
did him no harm in the public mind. That a
career is open to talent is a fact consolatory
only to a minority; flatter mere common-sense
with the same prospect, and every man feels himself
fit for the Bench&mdash;of Judges, Bishops, or
Ministers.</p>

<p>But as a lover&mdash;a wooer? Passion, impetuosity,
a total absorption, great eloquence in few words, the
eyes beating the words in persuasion&mdash;such seemed,
roughly, the requisites, as learnt by those who had
sat at Harry Belfield's feet and marked his practical
expositions of the subject. Andy was neither
passionate nor eloquent, not even in glances. Nor
was he absorbed. Gilbert Foot and Co. from
nine-thirty to two-thirty: the House from two-thirty
to eleven, with what Gilly contemptuously
termed "stoking" slipped in anywhere: there was
hardly time for real absorption. He was as hard-worked
as Mr. Freere himself, and, had he
married Mrs. Freere, would probably have made
little better success of it. He was not trying to
marry Mrs. Freere; but he was trying to win a
girl who had listened to wonderful words from
Harry Belfield's lips and suffered the persuasion
of Harry Belfield's eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_535" title="pg 535"></a>
In varying fashion his friends made their jesting
comments, with affection always at the back
of the joke; nay more, with a confidence that
the efforts they derided would succeed in face of
their derision&mdash;like the comic papers of future
days.</p>

<p>"He wants to marry, so he must make love;
but I believe he hates it all the time," said the
Nun compassionately.</p>

<p>"That shows his sense," remarked Sally Dutton.</p>

<p>"He's a natural monogamist," opined Billy
Foot, "and no natural monogamist knows anything
about making love."</p>

<p>"He ought to have been born married," Gilly
yawned, "just as I ought to have been born retired
from business."</p>

<p>Mrs. Billy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Amaranth Macquart-Smith) was
also of the party. Among these sallies she spread
the new-fledged wings of her wit rather timidly.
To say the truth, she was not witty, but felt bound
to try&mdash;a case somewhat parallel to his at whom her
shaft was aimed. She was liked well enough in the
circle, yet would hardly have entered it without
Billy's passport.</p>

<p>"He waits to be accepted," she complained, "as
a girl waits to be asked."</p>

<p>"Used to!" briefly corrected Miss Dutton.</p>

<p>Billy Foot cut deeper into the case. "He's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_536" title="pg 536"></a>
never imagined before that he could have a chance
against Harry. He's got the idea now, but it takes
time to sink in."</p>

<p>"Harry's out of it anyhow," drawled Gilly.</p>

<p>"Out of what?" asked the Nun.</p>

<p>Billy's nod acknowledged the import of the
question. Out of reason, out of possibility, out
of bounds! Not out of memory, of echo, of the
mirror of things not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"He still thinks he can't compete with Harry,"
she went on, "and he's right as far as this game
is concerned. But he'll win just by not competing.
To be utterly different is his chance." With a
glance round the table, she appealed to their experience.
"Nobody ever begins by choosing Andy&mdash;well,
except Jack Rock perhaps, and that was to
be a butcher! But he ends by being indispensable."</p>

<p>"You all like him," said Amaranth. "And yet
you all give the impression that he's terribly
dull!" Her voice complained of an enigma.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you know, what would a fellow
do without him?" asked Gilly, looking up from
his <i>pat&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"Gilly has an enormous respect for him. He's
shamed him into working," Billy explained to his
wife.</p>

<p>"That's it, by Jove!" Gilly acknowledged
<a class="pagenum" id="page_537" title="pg 537"></a>
sadly. "And the worst of it is, work pays!
Pays horribly well! We're getting rich. I've got
to go on with it." He winked a leisurely moving
eyelid at the Nun. "I wish the deuce I'd never
met the fellow!"</p>

<p>"I must admit he points the moral a bit too
well," Billy confessed. "But I'm glad to say we
have Harry to fall back upon. I met Harry in
the street the other day, and he was absolutely
radiant."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Sally Dutton.</p>

<p>"Not a bit, Sally! He's just given up Lady
Lucy. Going straight again, don't you know?
Off to the seaside with his wife and kid."</p>

<p>"How long has Lady Lucy lasted?" asked
Gilly.</p>

<p>The Nun gurgled. "I should like to have that
set to music," she explained. "The alliteration
is effective, Gilly, and I would give it a pleasing
lilt."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to hear you sing it," said Billy,
in a voice none too loud. Amaranth was looking
about the room, and an implied reference to bygones
was harmlessly agreeable.</p>

<p>"With his wife and his kid, to the Bedford at
Brighton," Billy continued, after his aside. "From
something he let fall, I gathered that the Freeres
were going to be at the Norfolk."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_538" title="pg 538"></a>
Amaranth did not see the point. "I don't
know the Freeres," she remarked.</p>

<p>"We do," said Gilly. "In fact we're in the
habit of turning them to the uses of allegory,
Amaranth. I may say that we are coming to
regard Mrs. Freere as a comparative reformation&mdash;as
the irreducible minimum. If only Harry
wouldn't wander from Freere's wife!"</p>

<p>"But the man's got a wife of his own!" cried
Amaranth.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're dealing with practical possibilities,"
Gilly insisted. "And, from that point
of view, his own wife really doesn't count."</p>

<p>"And yet Vivien Wellgood&mdash;!" The Nun
relapsed into a silence which was meant to express
bewilderment, though she was not bewildered,
having too keen a memory of her own achievement.</p>

<p>"Oh, you really understand it better than that,
Doris," said Billy. "Harry can make it seem a
tremendous thing&mdash;while it lasts. Andy's fault is
that he never makes things seem tremendous. He
just makes them seem natural. His way is safer;
it takes longer, but it lasts longer too. Neither of
them is the ideal man, you know. Andy wants an
occasional hour of Harry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dangerously long!" the Nun opined.</p>

<p>"And Harry ought to have seven years' penal
<a class="pagenum" id="page_539" title="pg 539"></a>
servitude of Andy. Then you might achieve the
perfectly balanced individual."</p>

<p>"I think you're perfectly balanced, dear," said
Amaranth, and thereby threw her husband into
sorest confusion, and the rest of the company into
uncontrolled mirth. Moreover the Nun must
needs add, with her most innocent expression,
"Just what I've always found him, Amaranth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it&mdash;when I was trying to talk sense!"
poor Billy expostulated.</p>

<p>His bride's remark&mdash;admirably bridal in character&mdash;choked
Billy's philosophising in its hour of birth.
The trend of the conversation was diverted, the
picture of the perfectly balanced man never painted.
Else there might have emerged the interesting and
agreeable paradox that the perfectly balanced man
was he who knew when to lose his balance, when
to kick the scales away for an hour, when to stop
thinking of anybody except himself, when to sink
consideration in urgency, pity in desire, affection in
love. All this, of course, only for an hour&mdash;and
in the right company. It must be allowed that the
perfect balance is a rare phenomenon.</p>

<p>Isobel Vintry had not sought it; it is to her
credit that she refrained from accusing fate because
she had not found what she did not seek. Forgiving
Harry over the Lady Lucy episode&mdash;his
penitence was irresistibly sincere&mdash;and accepting
<a class="pagenum" id="page_540" title="pg 540"></a>
Mrs. Freere as an orderly and ordinary background
to married life, almost a friend, certainly an ally
(for Mrs. Freere was now, as ever, a prudent
woman), she recalled the courage that had made
her a fit preceptress for Vivien, and Wellgood's
ideal woman. She saw the trick her heart had
played her, and knew&mdash;with Harry himself&mdash;that
hearts would always be playing tricks. The
poacher was made keeper, but the poaching did
not stop. The thief was robbed, the raider raided.
All a very pretty piece of poetical justice&mdash;with the
unusual characteristic of being quite commonplace,
an everyday affair, no matter of melodrama, but
just what constantly happens.</p>

<p>She and Wellgood had so often agreed that
Vivien must be trained to face the rubs of life, its
ups and downs, its rough and smooth; timidity
and fastidiousness were out of place in a world like
this. The two had taught the lesson to an unwilling
pupil; they themselves had now to aspire to
a greater aptitude in learning it. Wellgood conned
his lesson ill. The gospel of anti-sentimentality
fits other people's woes better than a man's own;
his seem so real as to defeat the application of the
doctrine. The first and loudest to proclaim that
no man or woman is to be trusted, that he who
does not suspect invites deception and has himself
to thank if he is duped&mdash;that is the man who
<a class="pagenum" id="page_541" title="pg 541"></a>
nurses bitterest wrath over the proving of his own
theories. Aghast at having yourself the honour
of proving your own theories! The world does
funny things with us. To be taken at your word
like that; really to find people about you as bad
as you have declared humanity at large to be; to
stumble and break your knees over a justification
of your cynicism&mdash;it would seem a thing that
should meet with acquiescence, perhaps even with
a sombre satisfaction. Yet it does not happen so.
The optimist fares better; he falls from a higher
chair but on to a thicker carpet; and he himself is
far more elastic. "With what measure you mete,
it shall be measured to you again." Hard measure
for hard people seems to fulfil the saying, and is
not a just occasion for grumbling&mdash;even for internal
grumbling, which is the hard man's only
resource, since he has accustomed sympathy and
confidence to hide their faces from his ridicule, and
their tender hands to shrink from the grip of his
contempt.</p>

<p>Isobel Belfield possessed just what Isobel Vintry
had stolen. Neither Church nor State, no, nor the
more primitive sanction of the birth of a son, availed
to give a higher validity to her title. In rebuking
inconstancy she was out of court; she was estopped,
as the lawyers call it. How could she refuse to
forgive the thing which alone gave her the right
<a class="pagenum" id="page_542" title="pg 542"></a>
to be aggrieved? Her possession was tainted
in its origin. Or was she to arrogate to herself
the privilege of being the only thief? Harry
Belfield confessed new crimes to an old accomplice;
severity would have merited a smile. Stolen kisses
acknowledged recalled stolen kisses that had been
a secret. Condemned by the tribunal of the
present, Harry's offences appealed to the past.
"See yourself as Vivien&mdash;see her (Lady Lucy,
Mrs. Freere, or another) as yourself!" Harry's
deprecatory smile seemed to threaten some such
disarming suggestion. Church and State and the
little boy might say, "There's all the difference!"
Neither State nor Church nor little boy could
deafen the echo of Wellgood's denunciation or
blur the image of Vivien's stricken face. They
were a pair of thieves; the court of conscience
would not listen to her plea if she complained of
an unfair division of the plunder. Hands held up
in petition for justice must be clean&mdash;an old doctrine
of equity; an account will not be taken between
two highwaymen on Hounslow Heath.</p>

<p>Origins are obstinate, leaving marks whatever
variations time may bring. She had begun as one
of two&mdash;and not the legitimate one. She was to
be one of two always, so it appeared, through all
the years until the Nun's pitiless vision worked
itself out, and even Harry Belfield ceased to suffer
<a class="pagenum" id="page_543" title="pg 543"></a>
new passions&mdash;or, at least, to inspire them; perhaps
the latter ending of the matter was the more likely.</p>

<p>He did nothing else than suffer passions and
inspire them; that was the hardest rub. Where
was the brilliant career? Where the great success
of which Vivien had been wont to talk shyly?
Isobel was a woman of hard mettle, of high ambition.
She could have endured to be official queen,
though queens unofficial came and went. But
there was to be no kingdom! There was abdication
of all realms save Harry's own. He grew
more and more contented to specialise there.
Irregularity in private conduct is partially condoned
in useful men; as a discreetly hidden diversion,
it is left to another jurisdiction&mdash;<i>deorum injuriae dis
curae</i>&mdash;but as the occupation of a life? The widest
stretch of philosophic contemplation of the whole
is demanded to excuse or to justify.</p>

<p>He made a strange thing of her life&mdash;a restless,
unpeaceful, interesting, and unhappy thing. The
old idea of reigning at Nutley, of skilfully managing
stubborn Wellgood, of the seeming submission
that was really rule (perhaps woman's commonest
conception of triumph), did not serve the turn
of this life. It was stranger work&mdash;living with
Harry! Being so well treated&mdash;and so well
deceived! So courted and so flouted! The
change was violent from the days when Vivien's
<a class="pagenum" id="page_544" title="pg 544"></a>
companion stole kisses that belonged to her unsuspecting
charge. A pretty irony to find herself
on the defensive! A prettier, perhaps, to
see her best resource in an alliance with Mrs.
Freere! But it came to that. Never in words,
of course&mdash;tacitly, in lifted brows and shoulders
shrugged. So long as there was nobody except
Mrs. Freere&mdash;so long as there was nobody besides
his wife&mdash;things were not very wrong for the allies.
A sense of security regained, precariously regained&mdash;a
current of silent but mutual congratulations&mdash;ran
between the Bedford and the Norfolk hotels at
Brighton when Lady Lucy had received her <i>cong&eacute;</i>.
Harry's degrees of penitence and of confession
at the two houses of entertainment must remain
uncertain; at both he was no doubt possessed by
the determination to lead a new life; he had been
possessed by that when first he heard the potent
voice calling him to Meriton.</p>

<p>Harry Belfield&mdash;the admired Harry of so many
hopes&mdash;was in process of becoming a joke! It
was the worst fate of all; yet what other refuge
had the despair of his friends? Even to condemn
with gravity was difficult; gravity seemed to
accuse its wearer of making too much of the
ridiculous&mdash;which was to be ridiculous himself.
In old days they had laughed at Harry's love
affairs as at his foible; he seemed all foible now&mdash;there
<a class="pagenum" id="page_545" title="pg 545"></a>
was nothing else. His life and its possibilities
had narrowed and dwindled down to that. Billy
Foot had tried to be serious on the subject. What
was the use, when there was only one question
to be asked about him&mdash;who was the latest woman?
An atmosphere of ridicule, kindly, tender, infinitely
regretful, yet still ridicule, enveloped the figure
of him who once had been a hero. This was a
different quality of jest from that which found its
occasion in Andy Hayes' patient wooing. Andy
could afford to be patient; once again his opponent
was doing his work for him.</p>

<p>Spring saw the Nun installed in a hired house
of her own at Meriton, Seymour being kept busy
conveying her to and fro between her new home
and London, as and when the claims of her
profession called her. But Sunday was always
marked by a gathering of friends&mdash;the Foots if
they were at Halton, Andy, Vivien Wellgood from
Nutley; often Belfield would drop in to see the
younger folk. Jack Rock had his audiences to
himself, for he sturdily refused to intrude on his
"betters"&mdash;aye, even though his sign was down,
though the National, Colonial, and International
Purveyors reigned in his stead, though the Member
for the Division occupied rooms in his house.
To Jack life seemed to have done two wonderful
things for him&mdash;one was the rise and triumph of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_546" title="pg 546"></a>
Andy; the other was his friendship with Miss
Doris Flower. He was, in fact, hopelessly in love
with that young lady; the Nun was quite aware
of it and returned his affection heartily. Jack
delighted to sit with her, to look and listen, and
sometimes to talk of Andy&mdash;of all that he had
done, of all that he was going to do. Jack's
hard-working, honest, and, it may be added, astute
life was crowned by a very gracious evening.</p>

<p>The Nun's new home stood in High Street,
with a pretty little front garden, where she loved
to sit and survey the doings of the town, even
as had been her wont from her window at the
Lion. Here she was one morning, and Jack Rock
with her. She lay stretched on a long chair, with
her tiny feet protruding from her white frock, her
hair gleaming in the sun, her eyes looking at Jack
with a merry affection.</p>

<p>"You do make a picture, miss; you fair do
make a picture!" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Don't flirt, Jack," said the Nun in grave
rebuke. "You ought to know by now that I
don't go in for flirtation, and I can't let even you
break the rules. Though I confess at once that
you tempt me very much, because you do it so
nicely. It's funny, Jack, that both you and I
should have chosen the single life, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Jack shook his head reproachfully. "Ah, miss,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_547" title="pg 547"></a>
that's where you're wrong! I'm not sayin' anythin'
against Miss Vivien&mdash;she's a sweet young
lady."</p>

<p>"What has Vivien got to do with single lives?"</p>

<p>"Well, miss, no offence, I hope? But if it
had been so as you'd laid yourself out&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;for Andy."</p>

<p>The Nun blushed just a little, and laughed just
a little also. "Oh, that's your idea, Jack? You
are a schemer!"</p>

<p>"I've got nothin' to say against Miss Vivien.
But I wish it had been you, miss," Jack persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, wouldn't you have been jealous?
Do say you'd have been jealous!"</p>

<p>"Keepin' him waitin' too the way she does!"
Jack's voice grew rather indignant. "It don't
look to me as if she put a proper value on him,
miss."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're just a little bit partial to
Andy?" the Nun suggested.</p>

<p>"And not a proper value on herself either, if
she's still hankerin' after Mr. Harry. Him as
is after half the women in London, if you can
trust all you hear."</p>

<p>The Nun's face was towards the street, Jack's
back towards it. The garden gate was open.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Nun softly. "Here comes
Vivien!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_548" title="pg 548"></a>
Poor old Jack was no diplomatist. He sprang
to his feet, red as a turkey cock, and turned round
to find Vivien at his elbow.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, miss," he stammered,
rushing at the conclusion that she had overheard.</p>

<p>Vivien looked at him in amused surprise. "But
what's the matter, Mr. Rock? Why, I believe
you must have been talking about me!" She
looked at the Nun. "Was he?" she asked
merrily.</p>

<p>"I don't know that it's much good trying to
deny it, is it, Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack was terribly ashamed of himself. "It
wasn't my place to do it. I beg your pardon,
miss." He stooped and picked up his hat, which
he had taken off and laid on the ground by him.
"Miss Flower's too kind to me, miss. She makes
me forget my place&mdash;and my manners."</p>

<p>Vivien held out her hand to him; she was grave
now. "But we're all so fond of you, Mr. Rock.
And I'm sure you weren't saying anything unkind
about me. Was he, Doris?"</p>

<p>Jack took her hand. "It wasn't my place to do
it. I ask your pardon." Then he turned to the
Nun. "You'll excuse me, miss?"</p>

<p>The Nun smiled radiantly at him. "I hate
your going, Jack. Perhaps you'd better, though.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_549" title="pg 549"></a>
Only don't be unhappy. There's no harm done,
you know."</p>

<p>Jack shook his head again sadly, then put his
hat on it with a rueful air. He regarded Vivien
for a moment with a ponderous sorrow, lifted his
hat again, shook his head again, and walked out
of the garden. The Nun gave a short gurgle,
and then regained a serene and silent composure.
It was most certainly a case for allowing the other
side to take first innings! Vivien sat down in the
seat that Jack had vacated in such sad confusion.</p>

<p>"It was about&mdash;Harry?" she asked slowly.
"You all hear and know! I hear nothing, I
know nothing. Nobody mentions him to me.
Not Andy, not my father any more. Mr.
Belfield said a word or two once&mdash;not happy
words. Except for that&mdash;well, he might be dead!
I don't see the use of treating me like that. I
think I've a right to know."</p>

<p>"What Jack said was more about you really.
There's no fresh news about Harry."</p>

<p>While saying these words, the Nun allowed her
look at Vivien to be very direct. "You must
accept that as final," the look seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Lots of men, good men, make a mistake, one
mistake, about things like that. He'll be all
right now&mdash;with his boy."</p>

<p>"He's had a love affair, repented of it&mdash;and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_550" title="pg 550"></a>
probably started another since that event. The
child, if I remember, is about five months old."
Still with her gaze direct, the Nun laughed.
Vivien flushed. "There's no other way to take
it," the Nun assured her.</p>

<p>Vivien spoke low; her cheeks red, her eyes
dim. "I gave him all my heart, oh, so readily&mdash;and
such trust! Doris, did he ever make love to
you?"</p>

<p>"As a general rule I don't tell tales. In this
case I feel free to say that he did."</p>

<p>Vivien's smile was woeful. "What, he wanted
to marry you too once?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he never wanted to marry me, Vivien."</p>

<p>It was drastic treatment&mdash;and the doctor paid
for it as well as the patient.</p>

<p>"But you went on being friends with him!"</p>

<p>"I became friends with him again&mdash;presently,"
the Nun corrected. "I suppose I don't come
well out of it, according to your views. I know
the difference there is between us in that way.
Look at your life and mine! That's bound to
make a difference. Besides, it would have been
taking him much too seriously."</p>

<p>"I think you're rather hard, Doris."</p>

<p>"Thank God, I am, my dear! I need it."</p>

<p>"It's a terrible thing to make the mistake I did."</p>

<p>"It's worse to go on with it."</p>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_551" title="pg 551"></a>"I should have liked to go on with it. I feel
as people must who've lost their religion."</p>

<p>"Is that so sad, if the religion is proved not to
be true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, terribly sad." Vivien's back was to the
street. She wept silently; none saw her tears
save Doris. "I thought I had lost everything.
It's worse to find that you never had anything, and
have lost nothing."</p>

<p>"It's good to find that out, when it's true,"
Doris persisted stoutly. "But I hope he won't
happen on any more girls like you. With the
proper people&mdash;his Mrs. Freeres and Lady Lucies&mdash;the
thing's a farce. That's all right!"</p>

<p>Her bitter ridicule pierced the armour of Vivien's
recollection. With the proper people it was all a
farce. She had taken it as a tragedy. Her tears
ceased to flow, but her colour came hot again.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about those women&mdash;I
never heard their names&mdash;but he seems to have
insulted me almost as much as he insulted you."</p>

<p>The Nun was relentless. "In both cases he
considered, and still considers, that he paid a very
high compliment. And he'll find lots of women
to agree with him."</p>

<p>"Doris, be kind to me. I've nobody else!"</p>

<p>"The Lord forgive you for saying so! You've
the luck of one girl in ten thousand." Now the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_552" title="pg 552"></a>
Nun's colour grew a little hot; she raised herself
on her elbow. "Here are your two men. One's
going to lead a big life, while the other's chasing
petticoats!"</p>

<p>"You think the world of Andy, don't you,
Doris?"</p>

<p>"I'd think the universe of him if he'd give you
a shaking."</p>

<p>Vivien smiled, rose, came to the Nun, and
kissed her. The Nun's lips quivered. "He's
coming down at the end of the week," said Vivien.
Her voice fell to a whisper. "He's not quite so
patient as you think." With another kiss she was
swiftly gone.</p>

<p>The Nun sat on, gazing at Meriton High
Street. Sally Dutton came out of the house and
regarded the same prospect with an air of criticism
or even of disfavour.</p>

<p>"I think it's all coming right about Vivien and
Andy," the Nun remarked.</p>

<p>Sally turned her critical eyes on her friend.
"Have you been helping?"</p>

<p>"Just a little bit perhaps, Sally." She paused
a moment. "I shall be rather glad to have it
settled."</p>

<p>The motor-car drew up at the door.</p>

<p>"You'll not have more than enough time for
lunch before your matin&eacute;e, Miss Flower," Seymour
<a class="pagenum" id="page_553" title="pg 553"></a>
observed, with his usual indifferent air. Not his
business whether she were in time, but he might
as well mention the matter!</p>

<p>"My hat and cloak!" cried the Nun, springing
up. She took Sally's arm and ran her into the
house with her. "Hurrah for work, Sally!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Sally threw her arms round her
friend's neck and exclaimed, with something very
like a sob, "Oh, my darling, if only you could
have everything you want!"</p>

<p>The Nun's lips quivered again; her bright eyes
were a little dim. "But, Sally dear, I never fall
in love!"</p>

<p>Miss Dutton relapsed, with equal abruptness,
into her habitual demeanour.</p>

<p>"Well, he's a man&mdash;and a fool like all the rest
of them!" she remarked.</p>

<p>The Nun gurgled. A record was saved&mdash;at the
last moment. Because she did not cry&mdash;any more
than she fell in love.</p>

<p>The Nun came out, equipped for the journey.
She was smiling still. "Do I look all right,
Seymour?"</p>

<p>"At the best of your looks, if I may say so,
Miss Flower."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Seymour. Get in with
you, Sally! You are a slow girl, always!"</p>

<p>She pressed Sally's hand as the car started.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_554" title="pg 554"></a>
"Much better like this, really. I have always
Seymour's admiration."</p>

<p>His name caught Seymour's ear. "I beg your
pardon, Miss Flower?"</p>

<p>"I only said you were an admirable driver,
Seymour."</p>

<p>"Naturally I drive carefully when you're in the
car, Miss Flower."</p>

<p>"There!" said the Nun triumphantly. "I told
you so, Sally!"</p>

<h2>Chapter XXVII.<a class="pagenum" id="page_555" title="pg 555"></a></h2>

<h2>NOT OF HIS SEEKING.</h2>

<p>Andy Hayes' <i>d&eacute;but</i> in the House of
Commons was not, of course, sensational;
very few members witnessed it, and nobody outside
took the smallest heed of it. Moreover, like
other beginnings of his, it was unpremeditated, in
a manner forced upon him. He had not intended
to speak that afternoon, or indeed at all in his
first session, but in Committee one day an honourable
gentleman opposite went so glaringly astray
as to the prices ruling for bacon in Wiltshire in
the year nineteen hundred and something&mdash;which
Andy considered a salient epoch in the chequered
history of his pet commodity&mdash;that he was on his
feet before he knew what he was doing, and set
the matter right, adding illustrative figures for the
year before and the year after, with a modestly
worded forecast of the run of prices for the current
year. Engrossed in the subject, he remembered
that the House was a formidable place only after
<a class="pagenum" id="page_556" title="pg 556"></a>
he had sat down; then he hurried home to his
books, found that his figures were correct, and
heaved a sigh of satisfaction. It was no small
thing to get his maiden speech made without
meaning to make it&mdash;and to find the figures correct!
He attempted nothing more that session. He
only listened. But how he listened! A man
might talk the greatest nonsense, yet Andy's steady
eyes would be on him, and Andy's big head untiringly
poised at attention. What was the use of
listening to so much nonsense? Well, first you
had to be sure it was nonsense; then to see why
it was nonsense; thirdly, to see how, being nonsense,
it was received; fourthly, to revolve how
it should be exposed. There were even other
things that Andy found to ponder over in all the
nonsense to which he listened&mdash;and many more, of
course, in the sense.</p>

<p>But even Andy took a holiday from public
affairs sometimes, nay more, sometimes from the
fortunes of Gilbert Foot and Co. He was in the
office this morning&mdash;the Saturday before Whitsunday&mdash;finishing
up some odd jobs which his
partner had left to him (Gilly had still a trick of
doing that), but his thoughts were on Meriton,
whither he was to repair in the afternoon. As he
mused on Meriton, he slowly shook the big head,
thereby indicating not despair or even despondency,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_557" title="pg 557"></a>
but a recognition that he was engaged on rather a
difficult job, perhaps on a game that he was not
very good at, but which had to be won all the
same. This particular game certainly had to be
won; his whole heart was in it. Yet now he was
accusing himself of a mistake; he had been impatient&mdash;impatient
that Vivien should still be less
than happy, that she should still dwell in gloom
with gloomy Wellgood, that she would not yet
come into the sunshine. Well, he would put the
mistake right that very day, for Vivien was to
lunch with him, attended by the Nun, with whom
she had been spending a night or two in town;
and then the three of them were to go to Meriton
in the motor-car together. The Nun was not
singing at this time.</p>

<p>"I must go slow," concluded Andy, whose
friends were already smiling at the deliberate gait
with which he trod the path of love. "Hullo,
there's an hour before lunch! I may as well
finish some of these accounts for Gilly."</p>

<p>This satisfaction he was not destined to enjoy.
He was interrupted by a visitor.</p>

<p>Harry Belfield came in, really a vision to gladden
an artist's eyes, in a summer suit of palest homespun&mdash;he
affected that material&mdash;with his usual blue
tie unusually bright&mdash;shirt and socks to match;
a dazzlingly white panama hat crowned his wavy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_558" title="pg 558"></a>
dark locks. He looked immensely handsome,
and he was gay, happy, and affectionate.</p>

<p>"Thought I might just find you, old chap,
because you're always mugging when everybody
else is having a holiday. Look here, I want you
to do something for me, or rather for Isobel.
I'm off yachting for three or four months&mdash;rather
a jolly party&mdash;and Isobel's going to take a house
in the country for herself and the boy. She
doesn't know much about that sort of business,
and I wanted to ask you to let her consult you
about the terms, and so on, to see she's not
done, you know. That'll be all right, won't it?
Because I really haven't time to look after it."</p>

<p>"Of course. Anything I can do&mdash;please tell
her. She's not going with you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Harry, putting his foot on the table
and regarding it fondly, as he had at a previous
interview in Andy's office. "No, not this trip,
Andy. She doesn't care much for the sea." The
slightest smile flickered on his lips. "Besides,
it's 'Men only' on board." The smile broadened
a little. "At least we're going to start that way,
and they're taking me&mdash;a respectable married man&mdash;along
with them to help them to keep their
good resolutions. Well, old boy, how do you
like it in the House? I haven't observed many
orations put down to you!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_559" title="pg 559"></a>
"I've only spoken once&mdash;hardly a speech. But
I'm working pretty well at it."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you are! And at it here too, I
suppose? Lazy beggar, Gilly Foot!"</p>

<p>"Gilly's woken up wonderfully. You'd hardly
know him."</p>

<p>Harry yawned. "Well, I'm wanting a rest," he
said. "I've had one or two worries lately. Oh,
it's all over now, but I shall be glad to get away
for a bit. By Jove, Andy, the great thing in
life is to be able to go where you like, and when
you like"&mdash;his smile flashed out again&mdash;"and
with whom you like, isn't it? Are you off anywhere
for Whitsuntide?"</p>

<p>"Only down to Meriton."</p>

<p>"Quiet!" But Harry had not always found
it so; it was the quieter for his absence.</p>

<p>"I like being there better than anywhere else,"
was Andy's simple explanation of his movements.</p>

<p>A clerk came in and handed him a card. "I
told the lady you had somebody with you, and
asked her to take a seat in the outer room for
a moment."</p>

<p>Andy read the card. "I'll ring," he said
absently, and looked across at Harry.</p>

<p>"Lady? Eminent authoress? Or is this not
business? Have her in&mdash;don't hide her, Andy!"</p>

<p>"It's Vivien Wellgood."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_560" title="pg 560"></a>
Harry turned his head sharply. "What brings
her here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I was to meet her and Doris
Flower for lunch, and go down with them to
Meriton afterwards. Perhaps something's happened
to stop it, and she's come to tell me."</p>

<p>A curious smile adorned Harry's handsome
features. He looked doubtful, yet decidedly
interested.</p>

<p>"I'd better go out and see her," said Andy.
"I mustn't keep her waiting."</p>

<p>Harry broke into a laugh, half of amusement,
half of impatience. "You needn't look so infernally
solemn over it! It won't kill her to
bow to me&mdash;or even to shake hands."</p>

<p>Andy came to a sudden resolution. Since chance
willed it this way, this way it should be.</p>

<p>"As you please!" he said, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Harry rose to his feet, and took off the panama
hat, which he had kept on during his talk with
Andy. His eyes were bright; the smile flickered
again on his lips. He had not seen Vivien since
that night&mdash;and that night seemed a very long way
off to Harry Belfield.</p>

<p>In the brief space before the door reopened,
a vision danced before Andy's eyes&mdash;a vision of
Curly the retriever, and of a girl standing motionless
in fear, and yet, because he was there, not
<a class="pagenum" id="page_561" title="pg 561"></a>
so much afraid. In his mind was the idea which
had suddenly taken shape under the impulsion
of chance&mdash;that she had better face the present
than dream of the past, better see the man who
was nothing to her, than pore over the memory
of him who had been everything. She might&mdash;nay,
probably would&mdash;resent an encounter thus
sprung upon her. Andy knew it; in this moment,
with the choice suddenly presented, he chose to
act for himself. Perhaps, for once in his life, he
yielded to a sort of superstition, a feeling that
the chance was not for nothing, that they three
would not meet together again without result.
Mingled with this was anger that Harry should
take the encounter with his airy lightness, that
his eyes should be bright and his lips bent in
a smile. Andy was ready for the last round of
the fight&mdash;and ready to take his chance. Suddenly
under the pressure of his thoughts&mdash;perforce, as
it were&mdash;he spoke out to Harry.</p>

<p>"None of this has been of my seeking," he said.</p>

<p>"None of what? What do you mean, old
fellow?"</p>

<p>There was no time for answer. Vivien was in
the room, and the clerk closed the door after she
had entered.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment on the threshold and
then moved quickly to Andy's side.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_562" title="pg 562"></a>
"I knew," she said. "I heard your voices."</p>

<p>"I'm just going," said Harry. "I won't interrupt
you. I had a hope that you wouldn't
mind just shaking hands with an old friend. I
should like it&mdash;awfully!" His smile now was
pleading, propitiatory, yet with the lurking hint
that there was sentimental interest in the situation;
possibly, though he could not be convicted of this
idea&mdash;it was too elusively suggested&mdash;that there
was, after all, a dash of the amusing.</p>

<p>She paused long on her answer. At last she
spoke quietly, in a friendly voice. "Yes, I'll
shake hands with you, Harry. Because it's all
over." She smiled faintly. "I'll shake hands
with you if Andy will let me."</p>

<p>"If Andy&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes; because my hand belongs to him now.
I came here to tell him so this morning." She
passed her left arm through Andy's and held out
her right hand towards Harry. Her lips quivered
as she looked up for a moment at Andy's face.
He patted her hand gently, but his eyes were set
on Harry Belfield.</p>

<p>The hand she offered Harry did not take. He
stretched out his for his hat, and picked it up from
the table in a shaking grip. The smile had gone
from his lips; his eyes were heavy and resentful;
he found no more eloquent, appropriate words.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_563" title="pg 563"></a>
"Oh, so that's it?" he said with a sullen sneer.</p>

<p>"It's none of it been of my seeking," Andy
protested again. In this last moment of the fight
the old feeling came strong upon him. He pleaded
that he had been loyal to Harry, that he was no
usurper; it had never been in his mind.</p>

<p>Harry stood in silence, fingering his hat. He
cast a glance across at them&mdash;where they stood
opposite to him, side by side, her arm in Andy's.
Very fresh across his memory struck the look on
her face&mdash;the trustful happiness which had followed
on the tremulous joy evoked by his wonderful
words. It was not his nor for him any more, that
look. He hated that it should be Andy's. He
gave the old impatient protesting shrug of his
shoulders. What other comment was there to
make? He was what he was&mdash;and these things
happened! The Restless Master plays these disconcerting
tricks on his devoted servants.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Harry," said both, she in her clear
soft voice, Andy in his weightier note, both with a
grave pity which recognised, even as did his shrug
of the shoulders, that there was no more to be said.
It was just good-bye, just a parting of the ways, a
severing of lives. Even good wishes would have
seemed a mockery; from neither side were they
offered.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_564" title="pg 564"></a>
With one more look, another slightest shrug,
Harry Belfield turned his back on them. They
stood without moving till the door closed behind
him.</p>

<p>He was gone. Andy gave a deep sigh and
dropped into the arm-chair by his office desk.
Vivien bent over him, her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why did you let me meet him, Andy?"</p>

<p>Andy was long in answering. He was revolving
the processes of his own mind, the impulse under
which he had acted, why he had exposed her to
such an ordeal as had once been in the day's work
at Nutley.</p>

<p>"It was a chance, your coming while he was
here, we three being here together. But since it
happened like that"&mdash;he raised his eyes to hers&mdash;"well,
I just thought that neither of us ought to
funk him." The utterance seemed a simple result
of so much cogitation.</p>

<p>But Vivien laughed softly as she daintily and
daringly laid her hand on Andy's big head.</p>

<p>"If I 'funked him' still, I shouldn't have come
at all," she said. "I think I'm just getting to
know something about you, Andy. You're like
some big thing in a dim light; one only sees you
very gradually. I used to think of you as fetching
and carrying, you know."</p>

<p>Andy chuckled contentedly. "You thought
<a class="pagenum" id="page_565" title="pg 565"></a>
about right," he said. "That's what I'm always
doing, just what I'm fit for. I shall go on
doing it all my life, fetching and carrying for
you."</p>

<p>"Not only for me, I think. For everybody;
perhaps even for the nation&mdash;for the world,
Andy!"</p>

<p>He caught the little hand that was playing over
his broad brow. "For you first. As for the rest
of it&mdash;!" He broke into a laugh. "I say, Vivien,
the first time I saw you I was following the hounds
on foot! That's all I can do. The hunt gets out
of sight, but sometimes you can tell where it's
going. That's about my form. Now if I was a
clever chap like Harry!"</p>

<p>With a laugh that was half a sob she kissed his
upturned face. "Keep me safe, keep me safe,
Andy!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Andy slowly rose to his feet, and, turning, faced
her. He took her hands in his. "By Jove, you
kissed me! You kissed me, Vivien!"</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "Well, of course I did!
Isn't it&mdash;usual?"</p>

<p>Andy smiled. "If things like that are going to
be usual&mdash;well, life's looking a bit different!" he
said.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were wild sounds in the outer
office&mdash;a door slammed, a furious sweet voice, a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_566" title="pg 566"></a>
swish of skirts. The door of the inner office flew
open.</p>

<p>"What about lunch?" demanded the Nun
accusingly.</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten it!" Vivien exclaimed.</p>

<p>"So had I, but I'm awfully hungry, now I
come to think of it," said Andy. "The usual
place?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Nun. "Somewhere else.
Harry's there&mdash;lunching alone! The first time
I ever saw him do that!" She looked at the pair
of them. Her remark seemed not to make the
least impression. It did not matter where or how
Harry Belfield lunched. She looked again from
Vivien to Andy, from Andy to Vivien.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Doris," said Vivien meekly.</p>

<p>The Nun addressed Andy severely. "Mrs.
Belfield will consider that you're marrying above
your station, Andy."</p>

<p>Andy scratched his big head. "Yes, Doris, and
she'll be quite right," he said apologetically. "Of
course she will! But a fellow can only&mdash;well, take
things as they come." He broke into his hearty
laugh. "What'll old Jack say?"</p>

<p>The Nun knew what old Jack would say&mdash;very
privately. "I wish it had been you, miss!" But
she had no envy in her heart.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_567" title="pg 567"></a>
"For people who do fall in love, it must be
rather pleasant," she observed.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is, I've got so little time," said
Andy.</p>

<p>The two girls laughed. "I only want you to
have time to be in love with one girl," Vivien
explained reassuringly.</p>

<p>"And, perhaps, just friends with another," the
Nun added.</p>

<p>Andy joined in the laughter. "I shall fit those
two things in all right!" he declared.</p>

<p>The afternoon saw them back at Meriton; it
was there that Andy Hayes truly tasted the flavour
of his good fortune. There the winning of Vivien
seemed no isolated achievement, not a bit of luck
standing by itself, but the master-knot among the
many ties that now bound him to his home. The
old bonds held; the new came. In the greetings
of friends of every degree&mdash;from Chinks, the Bird,
and Miss Miles, up to the great Lord Meriton
himself&mdash;in Wellgood's hard and curt, yet ready
and in truth triumphant, endorsement of an arrangement
that banned the very thought of the man he
hated, in old Jack's satisfaction in the vision of
Andy in due time reigning at Nutley itself (his bit
of sentiment about the Nun was almost swallowed
up in this)&mdash;most of all perhaps in Belfield's cordial
yet sad acceptance of his son's supplanter&mdash;he found
<a class="pagenum" id="page_568" title="pg 568"></a>
the completion of the first stage of his life's journey
and the definition of its future course and of its
goal. His face was set towards his destination;
the love and confidence of the friends of a lifetime
accompanied, cheered, and aided his steady progress.
No high thoughts were in his mind. To
find time for the work of the day, his own and
what other people were always so ready to leave
to him, and to move on a little&mdash;that was his task,
that bounded his ambition. Anything else that
came was, as he had said to Harry Belfield, not of
his seeking&mdash;and never ceased rather to surprise
him, to be received by him with the touch of
simple wonder, which made men smile at him even
while they admired and followed, which made
women laugh, and in a sense pity, while they
trusted and loved. He saw the smiles and
laughter, and thought them natural. Slowly he
came to rely on the love and trust, and in the
strength of them found his own strength growing,
his confidence gradually maturing.</p>

<p>"With you beside me, and all the dear old set
round me, and Meriton behind me, I ought to be
able to get through," he said to Vivien as they
walked together in the wood at Nutley before dinner.</p>

<p>She stopped by a bench, rudely fashioned out of
a tree trunk. "Lend me your knife, Andy, please."</p>

<p>He gave it to her, and stood watching while she
<a class="pagenum" id="page_569" title="pg 569"></a>
stooped and scratched with the knife on the side
of the bench. Certain initials were scratched out.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, pointing to the spot
where they had been.</p>

<p>"Only a memorandum of something I don't
want to remember any more," she answered. She
came back to him, blushing a little, smiling, yet
with tears in her eyes. "Yes, Meriton, and the
old friends, and I&mdash;we're all with you now&mdash;all of
us with all our hearts now, dear Andy!"</p>

<p>Andy made his last protest. "I'd have been
loyal to him all my life, if he'd have let me!"</p>

<p>"I know it. And so would I. But he wouldn't
let us." She took his arm as they turned away
from the bench. "The sorrow must be in our
hearts always, I think. But now it's sorrow for
him, not for ourselves, Andy."</p>

<p>In the hour of his own triumph, because of the
greatness of his own joy, tenderness for his friend
revived.</p>

<p>"Dear old chap! How handsome he looked
to-day!"</p>

<p>Vivien pressed his arm. "You can say that as often
as you like! There's no danger from him now!"</p>

<p>The shadow passed from Andy Hayes' face as
he turned to his own great joy.</p>

<h2>Notes on Nelson's New Novels.<a class="pagenum" id="page_570" title="pg 570"></a></h2>


<p class="center"><i>No work of unwholesome character or<br />
of second-rate quality will be<br />
included in this Series.</i></p>

<p>The novel is to-day <i>the</i> popular form of literary art.
This is proved by the number of novels published,
and by the enormous sales of fiction at popular prices.</p>

<p>While <i>Reprints</i> of fiction may be purchased for a
few pence, <i>New Fiction</i> is still a luxury.</p>

<p>The author of a New Novel loses his larger audience,
the public are denied the privilege of enjoying his
latest work, because of the prohibitive price of 4s. 6d.
demanded for the ordinary "six shilling" novel.</p>

<p>In another way both author and public are badly
served under the present publishing system. At certain
seasons a flood of new novels pours from the press.
Selection becomes almost impossible. The good novels
are lost among the indifferent and the bad. Good
service can be done to literature not only by reducing
the price of fiction, but by sifting its quality.</p>

<p>The number of publishers issuing new fiction is so
great, that the entrance of another firm into the field
demands almost an apology&mdash;at least, a word of explanation.</p>

<p>Messrs. Nelson have been pioneers in the issue of
reprints of fiction in Library Edition at Sevenpence.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_571" title="pg 571"></a>
The success of <i>Nelson's Library</i> has been due to the
careful selection of books, regular publication throughout
the whole year, and excellence of manufacture at a
low cost, due to perfection of machinery.</p>

<p>Nelson's Sevenpenny Library represents the best that
can be given to the public in the way of <i>Reprints</i> under
present manufacturing conditions.</p>

<p>Nelson's New Novels (of which this book is one of
the first volumes) represents the same standard of careful
selection, excellence of production, and lowest possible
price applied to <i>New Fiction</i>.</p>

<p>The list of authors of Nelson's New Novels for 1910
includes Anthony Hope, E. F. Benson, H. A. Vachell,
H. G. Wells, "Q," G. A. Birmingham, John Masefield,
Mrs. W. K. Clifford, J. C. Snaith, John Buchan, and
Agnes and Egerton Castle. Arrangements for subsequent
volumes have been made with other authors of
equally high standing.</p>

<p>Nelson's New Novels are of the ordinary "six shilling"
size, but are produced with greater care than most of
their competitors. They are printed in large, clear
type, on a fine white paper. They are strongly bound
in green cloth with a white and gold design. They are
decorated with a pretty end-paper and a coloured
frontispiece. All the volumes are issued in bright
wrappers. The books are a happy combination of
substantial and artistic qualities.</p>

<p>A new volume is issued regularly every month.</p>

<p>The price is the very lowest at which a large New
Novel with good material and workmanship, and with
an adequate return to author, bookseller, and publisher,
can be offered to the public at the present time.</p>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_572" title="pg 572"></a></p>
<h3><i>Descriptive Notes
on the Volumes for 1910:</i>&mdash;</h3>

<h3><span style="float: left">FORTUNE.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>J. C. Snaith.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Snaith is already known to fame by his
historical novels, his admirable cricketing story, his
essay in Meredithan subtlety "Brooke of Covenden,"
and his most successful Victorian comedy "Araminta."
In his new novel he breaks ground which has never before
been touched by an English novelist. He follows
no less a leader than Cervantes. His hero, Sir Richard
Pendragon, is Sir John Falstaff grown athletic and
courageous, with his imagination fired by much adventure
in far countries and some converse with the
knight of La Mancha. The doings of this monstrous
Englishman are narrated by a young and scandalized
Spanish squire, full of all the pedantry of chivalry. Sir
Richard is a new type in literature&mdash;the Rabelaisian
Paladin, whose foes flee not only from his sword but
from his Gargantuan laughter. In Mr. Snaith's romance
there are many delightful characters&mdash;a Spanish
lady who dictates to armies, a French prince of the
blood who has forsaken his birthright for the highroad.
But all are dominated by the immense Sir Richard,
who rights wrongs like an unruly Providence, and then
rides away.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">THE HISTORY OF MR. POLLY.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>H. G. Wells.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>If the true aim of romance is to find beauty and
laughter and heroism in odd places, then Mr. Wells is
a great romantic. His heroes are not knights and adventurers,
not even members of the quasi-romantic
professions, but the ordinary small tradesmen, whom
the world has hitherto neglected. The hero of the new
book, Mr. Alfred Polly, is of the same school, but he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_573" title="pg 573"></a>
is nearer Hoopdriver than Kipps. He is in the last
resort the master of his fate, and squares himself defiantly
against the Destinies. Unlike the others, he
has a literary sense, and has a strange fantastic culture
of his own. Mr. Wells has never written anything
more human or more truly humorous than the adventures
of Mr. Polly as haberdasher's apprentice, haberdasher,
incendiary, and tramp. Mr. Polly discovers
the great truth that, however black things may be,
there is always a way out for a man if he is bold enough
to take it, even though that way leads through fire and
revolution. The last part of the book, where the hero
discovers his courage, is a kind of saga. We leave him
in the end at peace with his own soul, wondering dimly
about the hereafter, having proved his manhood, and
found his niche in life.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">DAISY'S AUNT.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>E. F. Benson.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>It is Mr. Benson's chief merit that, without losing the
lightness of touch which makes good comedy, he keeps
a firm hold upon the graver matters which make good
fiction. The present book is a tale of conspiracy&mdash;the
plot of a beautiful woman to save her young niece
from a man whom she regards as a blackguard. None
of Mr. Benson's women are more attractive than these
two, who fight for long at cross-purposes, and end, as
all honest natures must, with a truer understanding.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">THE OTHER SIDE.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>H. A. Vachell.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>In this remarkable book Mr. Vachell leaves the beaten
highway of romance, and grapples with the deepest
problems of human personality and the unseen. It is
a story of a musical genius, in whose soul worldliness
conquers spirituality. When he is at the height of his
apparent success, there comes an accident, and for a
little soul and body seem to separate. On his return
to ordinary life he sees the world with other eyes,
but his clearness of vision has come too late to save his
art. He pays for his earlier folly in artistic impotence.
The book is a profound moral allegory, and none the
less a brilliant romance.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_574" title="pg 574"></a></p>
<h3><span style="float: left">SIR GEORGE'S OBJECTION.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>Mrs. W. K. Clifford.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford raises the old problem of heredity, and
gives it a very modern and scientific answer. It is the
story of a woman who, after her husband's disgrace
and death, settles with her only daughter upon the shore
of one of the Italian lakes. The girl grows up in
ignorance of her family history, but when the inevitable
young man appears complications begin. As
it happens, Sir George, the father of the lover, holds
the old-fashioned cast-iron doctrine of heredity, and
the story shows the conflict between his pedantry and
the compulsion of fact. It is a book full of serious interest
for all readers, and gives us in addition a charming
love story. Mrs. Clifford has drawn many delightful
women, but Kitty and her mother must stand
first in her gallery.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">PRESTER JOHN.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>John Buchan.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This is a story which, in opposition to all accepted
canons of romance, possesses no kind of heroine. There
is no woman from beginning to end in the book, unless
we include a little Kaffir serving-girl. The hero is a
Scottish lad, who goes as assistant to a store in the
far north of the Transvaal. By a series of accidents
he discovers a plot for a great Kaffir rising, and by a
combination of luck and courage manages to frustrate
it. From the beginning to end it is a book of stark
adventure. The leader of the rising is a black missionary,
who believes himself the incarnation of the medi&aelig;val
Abyssinian emperor Prester John. By means of
a perverted Christianity, and the possession of the ruby
collar which for centuries has been the Kaffir fetish,
he organizes the natives of Southern Africa into a
great army. But a revolution depends upon small
things, and by frustrating the leader in these small
things, the young storekeeper wins his way to fame
and fortune. It is a book for all who are young enough
in heart to enjoy a record of straightforward adventure.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_575" title="pg 575"></a></p>
<h3><span style="float: left">LADY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.</span>
<span style="float: right">"<i>Q.</i>"</span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Sir Oliver Vyell, a descendant of Oliver Cromwell,
is the British Collector of Customs at the port of Boston
in the days before the American Revolution. While
there he runs his head against New England Puritanism,
rescues a poor girl who has been put in the stocks for
Sabbath-breaking, carries her off, and has her educated.
The story deals with the development of Ruth
Josselin from a half-starved castaway to a beautiful
and subtle woman. Sir Oliver falls in love with his
ward, and she becomes my Lady and the mistress of
a great house; but to the New Englanders she remains
a Sabbath-breaker and "Lady-Good-for-Nothing." The
scene moves to Lisbon, whither Sir Oliver goes on
Government service, and there is a wonderful picture
of the famous earthquake. The book is a story of an
act of folly, and its heavy penalties, and also the
record of the growth of two characters&mdash;one from
atheism to reverence, and the other from a bitter
revolt against the world to a wiser philosophy. The
tale is original in scheme and setting, and the atmosphere
and thought of another age are brilliantly reproduced.
No better historical romance has been
written in our times.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">PANTHER'S CUB.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>Agnes and Egerton Castle.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This is the story of a world-famed prima donna,
whose only daughter has been brought up in a very
different world from that in which her mother lives.
When the child grows to womanhood she joins her
mother, and the problem of the book is the conflict of
the two temperaments&mdash;the one sophisticated and
undisciplined, and the other simple and sincere. The
scenes are laid in Vienna and London, amid all types
of society&mdash;smart, artistic, and diplomatic. Against
the Bohemian background the authors have worked
out a very beautiful love story of a young diplomatist
and the singer's daughter. The book is full of
brilliant character-sketches and dramatic moments.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">TREPANNED.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>John Masefield.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Mr. Masefield has already won high reputation as
poet and dramatist, and his novel "Captain Margaret"
showed him to be a romancer of a higher order. "Trepanned"
is a story of adventure in Virginia and the
Spanish Main. A Kentish boy is trepanned and carried
off to sea, and finds his fill of adventure among
Indians and buccaneers. The central episode of the
book is a quest for the sacred Aztec temple. The
swift drama of the narrative, and the poetry and
imagination of the style, make the book in the highest
sense literature. It should appeal not only to all
lovers of good writing, but to all who care for the record
of stirring deeds.</p>

<h3><span style="float: left">THE SIMPKINS PLOT.</span>
<span style="float: right"><i>George A. Birmingham.</i></span></h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>"Spanish Gold" has been the most mirth-provoking
of Irish novels published in the last few years, and
Mr. Birmingham's new book is a worthy successor.
Once more the admirable red-haired curate, "J. J.,"
appears, and his wild energy turns a peaceful neighbourhood
into a hotbed of intrigue and suspicion.
The story tells how he discovers in a harmless lady
novelist, seeking quiet for her work, a murderess whose
trial had been a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. He forms a scheme of
marrying the lady to the local bore, in the hope that
she may end his career. Once started on the wrong
tack, he works out his evidence with convincing logic,
and ties up the whole neighbourhood in the toils of
his misconception. The book is full of the wittiest
dialogue and the most farcical situations. It will be
as certain to please all lovers of Irish humour as the
immortal "Experiences of an Irish R. M."</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
